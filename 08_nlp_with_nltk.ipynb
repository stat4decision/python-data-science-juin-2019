AM\\nAnne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.\\nBy Anne-Marie Slaughter\\nPRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is\\ntightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world\\'s dithering and\\nsteadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone\\nwhile the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab\\nLeague have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-\\nflight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.\\nIt\\'s not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that \"Libya doesn\\'t sell much oil to the United\\nStates\" and that while Americans \"want to support democratic movements in the region,\" they are\\nalready doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab\\npopulations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our\\nprofessions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new\\nbeginning in the Muslim world — a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide\\nservices and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for\\nterrorist groups and violent extremism. It\\'s hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.\\nIt will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera\\'s director\\ngeneral, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming\\nfrom Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into\\nQaddati\\'s hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But\\nthese arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition\\nfighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by\\nsome of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of\\nforeign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that\\nincludes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab\\ndemocrats.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739568\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nIt won\\'t work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping\\nColonel Qaddafi\\'s air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and\\nhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential\\neffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi\\'s own calculations about\\nhis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although\\nColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political\\nmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his\\nmilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic\\nadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against\\nhim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his\\noffer of a negotiated departure.\\nIf it does work, we don\\'t know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal\\ndivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice\\nis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will\\nconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the\\nopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support\\ntheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama\\'s\\nJune 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.\\nLet\\'s arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could\\n\\'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of\\ncourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between\\nthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary\\'s reluctance to\\nparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to\\nragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need\\naction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.\\nMoreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi\\nwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.\\nThe United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and\\nmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition\\nwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as\\npossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an\\ninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should\\nrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has\\ndone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739568\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And the creation of an anti-Islamic video\\n(ironically entitled \"Innocence of Muslims\") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst\\n(or excuse) for the protests.\\nWhy Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed\\nMost Americans operate by a different \"we.\" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly\\nattack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.\\nLibyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, \"I\\ncondemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free\\npeople everywhere.\"\\n\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the\\nInternet,\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. \"The United States deplores any intentional effort to\\ndenigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning\\nof our nation.\"\\nIn a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as\"This Is Water,\" novelist David\\nFoster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the \"natural, basic self-centeredness\" that puts \"me\" at the center of\\nthe world.\\nThis unconscious \"default setting\" fosters the sort of \"blind certainty\" that manifests as arrogant atheism and\\nfundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that \"default setting\" — to\\nbegin to see things from the perspectives of others.\\nFollow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739590\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

It was made by anAmerican.\\nMoreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual\\nAmericans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the\\nprotests turned deadly, condemning \"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious\\nfeelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\"\\nCNN\\'s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories\\nMeanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed \"Innocence of Muslims\" are imprisoned in some\\ngroupthink of their own, which gathers all the world\\'s Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.\\nTheir film doesn\\'t just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as\\ndupes.\\nUnfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.\\nWhen questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself\\nas \"Sam Bacile\" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that \"Islam is a cancer.\"\\nYou don\\'t need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,\\nand you don\\'t need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.\\nI am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and\\nreligion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than\\noffending them with an ignorant movie.\\nNonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as \"blind certainty.\"\\nOur world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and\\nHindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.\\nNeither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.\\nThe real \"red line\" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent\\ndays, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of\\ninnocents in Libya and Egypt.\\nBoth groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of \"blind certainty,\" unacquainted with both the complexity and\\ncontradictions of life on Earth and the \"cloud of unknowing\" that hovers over every major religion.\\nThe great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not\\nknow everything.\\nThey knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of\\nordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying\\nthe world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.\\nThe killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence\\nof Islam.\"\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739590\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

These officers, who\\nhave experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyan\\ntroops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons.\\nThis source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain, but there are\\nreports of deaths among some Qaddafi\\'s senior security officials, including Mansour Daw, and that the Libyan\\nleader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services have\\nbeen unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for French\\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy, who, according to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emerge\\nfrom this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.\\nSarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan Fighting\\nGroups and Al Qa\\'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.\\nAccordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6\\nnations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terrorist\\ngroups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of the\\nMuslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership.\\nThese sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the following\\nrebel figures in Benghazi:\\nMESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi\\'s former head of protocol, who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyan\\nleaders most loyal follower.

But [the Romney campaign] will try to\\npaint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.\"\\nHe said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a\\nhelpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter\\'s failed\\nattempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. \"They are so excited about it,\" he said. \"Over\\nand over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter\\'s failed raid. They feel it is\\ngoing to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.\"\\nThe source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. \"To me, it is indicative that they have lost\\ntouch with a huge portion of the electorate,\" he said.\\nThe source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present.

He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the\\noperation.\\nHowever, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,\\nSeptember 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama\\'s reaction to what happened in Libya\\n\"inexplicable\" and added that Obama is \"more intent on campaigning than meeting his\\nresponsibilities as commander-in-chief.\" He went on to warn that Obama\\'s policies in Libya\\nendangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. \"I am astonished,\" Rove said. \"We are projecting weakness\\nwhen we need to be projecting strength.\"\\nSimilarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who\\nbecame known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \"This\\nis a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the\\nmost transparent in history,\" he told Fox News. \"And it\\'s the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of\\ncover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four\\nAmericans.\"\\nGiuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it\\nseemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \"I think it\\'s because they have this\\nnarrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\" he said. \"They never say the words \\'Islamic fundamentalist\\nterrorism\\'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declare\\nthis a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very\\nconvenient narrative.\"\\nLikewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration\\'s response to\\n\"the terrorist attack\" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and\\nvice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \"I think they want to do their very best to\\nkeep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect\\ntransparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,\" Romney said.\\nAdded Ryan, \"Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are\\nsaying that this is a terrorist attack? We\\'ll leave it up to you to decide whether it\\'s a cover-up or not.\"\\nIn an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were\\ndivided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One\\nunnamed Romney adviser described them as \"a huge gift\" to the campaign. \"Across the board —\\ndomestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events,\" he\\nsaid. \"He\\'s an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he\\'s been outmatched.\"\\nBut other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as\\nthe central issue. \"They\\'ll tell you that you\\'ve got to focus people on the fact that their economic\\nprospects are not very good and all that,\" the aide told Politico. \"Well, Romney\\'s been trying to do that\\nnow since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he\\'s failed. The president is better at\\ndeflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on\\nindividual voters.\"\\nCraig Unger is the New York Times bestselling author of \"House of Bush, House of Saud,\" and a\\nfrequent analyst on CNN, ABC Radio, Air America, The Charlie Rose Show, NBC\\'s Today Show and\\nother broadcast outlets.

Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I\\'m biased.\\nMitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East\\nRestore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.\\nDisturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim\\nBrotherhood has come to power, and the country\\'s peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.\\nembassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all\\nthe while promising to annihilate Israel.\\nThese developments are not, as President Obama says, mere \"bumps in the road.\" They are major issues that put our security at risk.\\nYet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We\\'re not moving them in a direction that protects our people or\\nour allies.\\nAnd that\\'s dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel\\'s security is compromised, America could be\\npulled into the maelstrom.\\nWe still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East\\nThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We\\'re unique in having earned that role not\\nthrough conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through\\ntrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.\\nBut in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"recovery\" that barely deserves the name. Our national\\ndebt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.\\nFinally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.\\nBy failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.\\nHe does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.\\nThe Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented\\ngrave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few\\nweeks\\nThe same incomprehension afflicts the president\\'s policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"daylight\" between our two\\ncountries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"closest ally\" in the Middle East to being only \"one of our closest allies.\" It\\'s a diplomatic message that will\\nbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel\\'s concerns about Iran as mere \"noise\" that he prefers to \"block out.\" And at a time when\\nIsrael needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\nIn this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals who\\nshare our values.\\nThis means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,\\nthe ayatollahs must be made to believe us.\\nIt means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for\\nthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to\\nextremism.\\nBut this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of\\nour values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739629\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

A couple Sundays ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talk\\nshows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was \"spontaneous\"\\nrather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was a\\nMormon.\\nOut came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneous\\nevent.

Rice was\\njust covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama\\'s nominating her to succeed\\nHillary Clinton as secretary of State.\\nThe commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to the\\nwall.

Rice did\\nnot make up the \"spontaneous\" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators.\\nShe got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intel\\nreports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed more\\nor less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslim\\nfigures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador Christopher\\nStevens. Rice didn\\'t make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with the\\ninevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.\\nHer mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers made\\nthe same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what the\\nintelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory information\\nwould appear soon enough.

She wasn\\'t asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our\\nview that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the\\ninvestigation, specifically: And we\\'ll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what\\ntranspired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.\" But she got pushed\\nthere.\\nWaiting on other transcripts.\\nFor more on what happened and why, let\\'s bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan\\nRice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.\\nRICE: Good to be with you, Jake.\\nTAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at\\nthe consulate in Benghazi? We\\'re hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They\\'re saying that some\\npeople involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What\\'s the\\nlatest information?\\nRICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it\\'s important to know that there\\'s an FBI investigation that has begun and\\nwill take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.\\nBut our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what\\nthis began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In\\nCairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this\\nvery offensive video that was disseminated.\\nWe believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,\\nrather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to\\nhave been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,\\nweapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and\\naccessible. And it then evolved from there.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739704\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And that\\'s why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the\\npresident has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the\\ngovernments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and\\nwe\\'re reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...\\nTAPPER: But why...\\nRICE: ... and where needed.\\nTAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this\\n-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in\\nprevious months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?\\nRICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every\\nfacility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,\\nas in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We\\'ve been back post-revolution only for a matter of\\nmonths.\\nBut I\\'ve visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security\\npresence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a\\nplace where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State\\nDepartment thought were required were in place. And we\\'ll see when the investigation unfolds whether\\nwhat was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.\\nBut the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will\\nremain our top priority. That\\'s why we\\'ve reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739704\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And President Obama pledged to repair America\\'s relationships with the Muslim world. Why does\\nthe U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab\\ncountries than it was four years ago?\\nRICE: Jake, we\\'re not impotent. We\\'re not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don\\'t know\\non what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...\\nTAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts.\\nRICE: It\\'s actually the opposite. First of all, let\\'s be clear about what transpired here. What happened this\\nweek in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...\\nTAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...\\nRICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that\\nthe U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.\\nWe have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have\\ncondemned it in the strongest possible terms.\\nBut let\\'s look at what\\'s happened. It\\'s quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the\\ngovernments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And\\nas soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.\\nPresident Morsi...\\nTAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.\\nRICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He\\'s called off --\\nand his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop.\\n(CROSSTALK)\\nRICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the\\ngovernment has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what\\nhas happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their\\nrevolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated\\nanti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the\\noutpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government\\nof Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection\\nof the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739704\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And since you\\nbrought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked\\nabout the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nOBAMA: I don\\'t think that we would consider them an ally, but we don\\'t consider them an enemy. They\\nare a new government that is trying to find its way.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nTAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few\\ndecades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO\\nally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?\\nRICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a\\nvery critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the\\npresident wasn\\'t signaling any change in -- in the nature...\\nTAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?\\nRICE: The president wasn\\'t signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the\\npresident had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored\\nthat it\\'s, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel\\nand facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic\\nsteps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly\\nmade a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the\\nmessage that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against\\nthe United States or other Western partners.\\nSo what we\\'ve seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly\\nmeasured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured\\nthat in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come\\nout and made very plain that there\\'s no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of\\nTurkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there\\'s no excuse for\\nviolence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United\\nStates personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.\\nTAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge\\nPresident Morsi, \"Get your act together\"?\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739704\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant\\nmilitary advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed \"Operation Mermaid Dawn,\" the\\ntiming gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up\\nactivity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently\\npromoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,\\ndown almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than\\nthe authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for\\nTripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely\\nmanner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC\\njust issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human\\nrights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward\\nthinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not\\nWhile there\\'s a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have\\ntranslated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two\\nhours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than\\nhead any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance\\nhere. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli\\nfall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,\\nwhich after Qadhafi\\'s flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of\\nhow to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do\\nthe extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for\\nTripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to\\nthe military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)\\npassing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support\\nthere and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an\\nalternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to\\nremind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum\\nthat others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.\\nWe\\'ve talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the\\nbest solution. One of the TNC\\'s assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote\\nand how Qadhafi has treated Libya\\'s citizens. The world\\'s attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and\\nacts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even\\nmore than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC\\'s credibility\\ncould be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would\\nunderscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the\\nBenghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They\\nfeel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no\\nmatter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that\\nthe TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same\\ncategory as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi\\'s departure, a military\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739732\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Tarhouni also\\nacknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and\\nnot a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,\\nMohammed Ismail\\'s multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is\\nprepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla\\nwar could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.\\nAmong other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the\\nreconciliation which is part of the TNC\\'s platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi\\'s 42-year rule will be less\\nlikely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through\\nrule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained\\nas part of Qadhafi\\'s regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC\\nofficials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an\\ninclusive process for Libya\\'s future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still\\nseem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the \"gentle character\" of the Libyan people as the\\nbest assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.\\nBenghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation\\ncommittees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension\\nand gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had\\npreviously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are\\nnow looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and\\npillaging that destroyed Benghazi\\'s security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance\\nto Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National\\nSecurity Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist\\nleanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people\\nnoted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,\\nagain, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was\\nwidespread disdain for Qatar\\'s role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here\\nwhen I go to Doha later. Qatar\\'s role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.\\nWe also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC\\'s financial needs increase as\\nmore territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can\\'t provide electricity to newly liberated towns\\nor fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to\\ndiscuss Libya\\'s outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India\\'s hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on\\nSouth Africa\\'s objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa\\nproblem may derive from Jibril\\'s poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making\\nNelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out\\nattending himself. I\\'ve spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the\\nUAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way\\nof getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE\\'s needs and passes the scrutiny of the\\nU.S. interagency process.\\nMy traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.\\nI will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril\\nagain in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi\\'s propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt\\'s role\\napproaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I\\nneed to join Chris here in the coming days.\\nChris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here.

STATE-5CB0045746Have not seen - will see if we can get\\n----Associated Press\\nPublished September 21, 2012\\nBENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week\\'s killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the\\ncompound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building\\nFriday.\\nIn an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya\\'s rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the\\nAnsar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.\\nAnsar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their\\nweapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting \"No to militias.\"\\n\"I don\\'t want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to\\nsee people in uniform,\" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which\\nprotesters said was done in support of the army and police.\\nNo deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed\\nmilitias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.\\nFor many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest\\nproblems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the\\nmultiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the\\nregular armed forces and police.\\nThe militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi\\'s regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya\\'s\\nrevolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals\\nand carrying out killings.\\nMilitias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don\\'t abide by their\\nhardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which\\nkilled Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\\nAfter taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist\\nmilitia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were\\nwounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.\\nEarlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on\\nFriday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.\\n\"No, no, to militias,\" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that\\nmilitias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. \"Benghazi is in a trap,\"\\nsigns read. \"Where is the army, where is the police?\"\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739766\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nOther signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, \"The ambassador was Libya\\'s friend\" and \"Libya lost a friend.\"\\nMilitary helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the\\nprotesters.\\nThe march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya\\'s second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of\\nQaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been\\nunable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials\\' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled\\nthe growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.\\nResidents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.\\nThe anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of\\nBenghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a\\ndeadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.\\nA significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.\\nDuring the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi\\'s regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and\\nally itself with Al Qaeda.\\nBut now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.\\n\"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,\" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim\\npreacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio\\nshow he hosts. \"We felt that the revolution is going in vain.\"\\nLeaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias\\ndisband.\\nTribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no\\nlonger have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are\\nkilled.\\nActivists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna\\'s Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put\\nan end to the \"state of terrorism\" created by the militias.\\nMilitiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of\\nelderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,\\nreportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and\\nassassinations of former officers from Qaddafi\\'s military.\\nDarna\\'s residents are conservative, but they largely don\\'t fit the city\\'s reputation as extremists.\\nWomen wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In\\nthe ancient city\\'s narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare\\nWestern songs.\\nAnd many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah\\'s talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group\\'s name\\nmeans \"Supporters of Shariah Law.\"\\n\"We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,\" said Wassam ben\\nMadin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising\\nagainst Qaddafi. \"This is not the time for talk about Sharjah.

We will tell\\nthem you are from us and you fought for us\" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But \\'if you say no (to integrating into\\nthe) police and army, we will storm your place. It\\'s over.\"\\nOfficials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The\\narmed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.\\nSo the government has created a \"High Security Committee\" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to\\nintegration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average\\npolice monthly salary of around $200.\\nHowever, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only\\nprompted more militias to form.\\nOfficials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war\\nagainst Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several\\nhundred thousand.\\n\"All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,\" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. \\'The\\ngovernment is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster.\"\\n###\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739766\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a\\nmajor transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this\\none to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation\\nwith military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.\\nThe resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair\\ncame to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,\\ncreates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of\\nnon-military approaches.\\nWhen he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President\\nGeorge W. Bush as the general who transformed the military\\'s approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was\\nreflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,\\nObama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man\\ncould offer him.\\nPetraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a\\nmilitary solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed\\nwith Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy\\napproach.\\nWith the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned\\nabout the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to\\npay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. His focus as commander of\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739802 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nDate: 05/13/2015 SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

It is still a military\\nanswer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and\\ncultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special\\nops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the\\nsame old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to\\nemploy which tactics to defeat the enemy?\\nWhat atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the\\nother tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and\\nlegal leverage.\\nPerhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating\\nlack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was\\nstunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.\\nofficials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular\\ngovernment. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.\\nThe first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core\\nfunction: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the\\nsecretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone\\nin the air, as has been reported, that\\'s 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining\\nan intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at\\nthe helm of the CIA.\\nAnother main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of\\ntransition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign\\npolicy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart,\\nadaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be\\nattracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.\\nBut the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death\\nof Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive\\nways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.\\nStevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the\\nregion to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment\\nand helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically\\nuntenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.\\nAnd faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a\\nsecretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.\\nPerhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,\\nrestructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the\\ncurrent crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.\\nSarah Chayes, former special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. of Staff is a resident associate at the\\nCarnegie Endowment and a contributing writer to Opinion.\\nUNCLASSIFar\\nEtiVright 2012, Los Angeles Times\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739802 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nDate: 05/13/2015 SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.\\n11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on\\nthe anniversary.\\nThe focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack\\nObama\\'s first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term.\\nRice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: \"As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to\\nappear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were\\nprimarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American\\ndiplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran\\'s nuclear program.\"\\nHours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-\\nIslamic blasphemy.

He spent 10 years as an information management officer\\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the\\nservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and\\nfinally to Benghazi.\\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,\\nand we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.\\nToday, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How\\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —\\nnot the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.\\nLibyans carried Chris\\' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to\\nsafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America\\'s interest and security, and we will not\\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\\nbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and\\nsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher\\npriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine\\nthe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to\\njustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo\\nyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America\\'s commitment\\nto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is\\nno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long\\nas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a\\ntrue and lasting peace.\\nIt is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It\\'s an anniversary that means a\\ngreat deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet\\nfinished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world\\ncontinues.

Before I begin to\\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\\nviolence.\\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the\\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\\ncontent and message. America\\'s commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the\\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\\ndiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\\nunderstuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I would\\nnote that in today\\'s world with today\\'s technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\\ncivil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy\\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\\nriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\\nfuture.\\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you\\'ve undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\\nearlier this year. I told my team: \"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\" No\\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we\\'re not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\\nlongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\\nthemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\\nthis issue.\\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco\\'s autonomy plan is\\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\\ntoward resolution.\\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco\\'s economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially\\namong young people.\\nThat\\'s why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign\\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I\\'m\\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\\nToday, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I\\'d like to increase\\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco\\'s stability and\\nMorocco\\'s very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\\nbenefits for Moroccans.\\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And so we are\\npartnering to help strengthen Morocco\\'s criminal justice system and law enforcement.\\nThere will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly\\nappreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your\\nsupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new\\ndemocratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial\\nmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely\\ntogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.\\nFinally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th\\nanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.\\nThere are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr.\\nBenjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from\\npreserving Morocco\\'s historic sites to empowering youth, there\\'s one area I particularly hope we\\ncan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue.\\nIn these tense and turbulent times, it\\'s more important than ever for people of different faiths to\\nexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It\\'s one of the great\\nchallenges of the 21st century, and it\\'s one that we must address together.\\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\\nour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\" I\\'m\\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\\nstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for\\nthe world.\\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister. It\\'s been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to\\nwork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your\\ndistinguished delegation.\\nThank you.

They were good and\\nbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of\\nLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\\nambassador.\\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\\nAMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I\\'m the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time\\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\\nthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.\\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\\ntheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nWhen all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of\\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\\nresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone\\'s obligation to\\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\\nothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\\none\\'s faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one\\'s faith is unshakable.\\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.\\nBut that\\'s not what I believe, and I don\\'t think it\\'s what you believe either here tonight. Part of\\nwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in\\nour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us\\nmoving forward in a positive direction.\\nSo tonight I think it\\'s important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,\\nbut also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are\\ndoing to help shape that better future.\\nTwo years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation\\nChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I\\nasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to\\nhelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you\\ntonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you\\'re going to meet some of these young\\nleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.\\nThe Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building\\nan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.\\nThey act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when\\nneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual\\nunderstanding and respect, one person at a time.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages\\nyoung people to put themselves in another person\\'s shoes through service projects. So far, young\\npeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a\\ndifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but\\nanother real live person — people who don\\'t look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with\\nwhom we will share this planet.

I\\'m particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from\\ntonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,\\nfrankly, for us who are older as well.\\nLet me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these\\nefforts.

One young\\nwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said\\n\"Thugs and killers don\\'t represent Benghazi nor Islam,\" The President of the Palestinian\\nAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter\\nremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — \"an act of ugly terror.\"\\nMany others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.\\nThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We\\'ve seen the\\nheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We\\'ve seen rage\\nand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to\\ndo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is\\ntotally unacceptable.\\nThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the\\ntyranny of a mob.

I\\'m sure as you know already, we are\\ntaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That\\nincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And\\nwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who\\nmurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.\\nThe FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing\\nmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the\\nsame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight\\nhow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the\\nworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they\\nknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and\\nsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.\\nNow, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to\\ndiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends\\nas well as partner on dozens of critical issues.

And I think the habits of cooperation we\\nhave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time\\nto come.\\nToday, our delegations reviewed the gains we\\'ve made on key priorities, including improving\\nlaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border\\ninfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered\\ncommunities. We also discussed the lessons we\\'ve learned and the work that lies ahead in these\\nand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our\\nsecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.\\nThe Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these\\ncriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to\\nsupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational\\nproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of\\nshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to\\nMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are\\nsafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.\\nNow, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and\\ngirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a\\nMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender\\nequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.\\nSo again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive\\nconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable\\ncolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and\\nthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

So thank you very much.\\nMS. NULAND: We\\'ll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.\\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed\\nAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya\\'s President says this attack was planned for months. Are you\\nconfident he\\'s wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to\\nthe Libyans?\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our\\npeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security\\nposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-\\nneeds are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring\\nthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,\\ncolleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside\\nLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.\\nIt is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.\\nIn a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists\\nwho are trying to exploit people\\'s inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,\\nwe have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to\\ntrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the\\nfuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong\\npartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual\\nrespect.\\nThis is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in\\ntheir first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in\\nall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in\\norder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American\\nfacilities.\\nAnd as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist\\nefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as\\nto the region and the United States. And I think it\\'s important at this moment for leaders to put\\nthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against\\nviolence, whoever incites it or conducts it\\nAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support\\nthose who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to\\nunderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and\\naround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that\\nthey experienced can be realized.\\nAnd finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about\\nsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our\\nsecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard\\nforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security\\noutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.\\nAnd with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid\\', as is done every year, we\\ndid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has\\nsaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or\\nimminent.\\nBut let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it\\'s the nature\\nof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but\\nto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what\\nwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every\\nsingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols\\nreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.\\nThank you.\\nRemarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana\\nNatalegawa After Their Meeting\\nSeptember 20, 2012\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it\\'s such a pleasure, as always, to\\nwelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come\\nfrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.\\nThis commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,\\nand the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States\\nand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to\\nclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.\\nAnd today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time\\nof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very\\nimpressed. We covered a great deal today.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nBut before I start, I\\'d like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the\\nworld. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from\\nthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and\\nreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\\nBut there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his\\ngovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and\\nresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of\\nthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.\\nToday\\'s meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of\\nour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I\\'m\\nannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight\\nAH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will\\nstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.\\nOn growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last\\nyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting\\neconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone\\nrepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia\\'s Government has announced half\\na trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of\\nunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.\\nAnd yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge\\nCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600\\nmillion in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help\\nmake Indonesia\\'s Government more transparent and open.\\nThe United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are\\nconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic\\nintegration across the Asia Pacific.\\nBoth the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem\\nglobal economy. That\\'s why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and\\nsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic\\nexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the\\nUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education\\nprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.\\nAnd we\\'re providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The Foreign Minister\\'s\\npersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as\\nit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN\\'s six-point principles,\\nwhich we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of\\nconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.\\nFinally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,\\nfrom democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence\\nin Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular\\ncooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on\\nwomen\\'s empowerment.\\nWe believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and\\nIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last\\nfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic\\ntransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And\\nonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.\\nSo, Minister, thank you for everything.

NULAND: We\\'ll take two questions today, we\\'ll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera\\nEnglish.\\nQUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my\\nquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week\\'s attack at the consulate in Benghazi.\\nYou are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the\\nconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an\\naccountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there\\ncertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of\\nForeign Service Officers around the world?\\nAnd related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are\\nyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in\\nthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of\\nrumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt\\nthat he was on a, quote, \"al-Qaida hit list\" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor\\nwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to\\nwhat he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in\\na classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and\\nwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be\\njoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary\\nof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,\\nalong with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.\\nNow, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,\\nand the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our\\npeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the\\nintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the\\nsuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the\\nvery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.\\nAnd I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be\\nchaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.\\nI will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of\\nthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,\\nthese fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries\\ndid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are\\nconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the\\ninternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and\\nchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore\\nsecurity and civil order.\\nAnd let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.\\nWe continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work\\nin Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal\\nrights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where\\nthat person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of\\nCongress.\\nAs to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there\\'s any\\nbasis for that.\\nQUESTION: Thank you.\\nMS.

If it\\'s continuing happen, it\\'s —\\nobviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is\\nthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your\\nexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia\\nGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it\\'s starting today? Is U.S. —\\nIndonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)\\nprogram implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent\\ncooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law\\nenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the\\ncooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong\\nstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.\\nIn consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed\\nour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it\\nneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are\\ncooperating completely, and we\\'re very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.\\nFOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.\\nPrecisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close\\ntemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that\\'s been made\\nbased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United\\nStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to\\nshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it\\'s quite some — it\\'s the\\nkind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.\\nSome of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the\\nembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is\\nactually coordinated as well.\\nBut if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,\\nIndonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone\\nthe — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because\\nthat is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among\\nstates. So that\\'s our point of departure.\\nAt the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have\\nstill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We\\'ve had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other\\nsettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral\\nrelationship as well as regional and global issues.\\nI want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we\\'ve once again\\nseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned\\nviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their\\nefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.\\nAnd I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot\\nbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have\\ncertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that\\'s at\\nthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.\\nBut that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible\\nleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and\\nparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own\\nextremist ideologies.\\nYesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people\\neverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist\\nattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who\\nmurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect\\nour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important\\ncontributions to the work of our missions.\\nThe Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no\\nsecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And\\nwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,\\nbut we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week\\nat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we\\nshare — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.\\nOur number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure\\nthe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common\\nenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated\\nthe Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every\\navailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan\\'s parliament has called for\\nexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan\\'s territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani\\nGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.\\nAnd the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working\\nwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a\\nsecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I\\nwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan\\'s reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow\\nthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.\\nWe will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad\\nwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process\\nin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government\\'s public call for insurgents to come forward and talk\\nwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build\\non these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-\\nAfghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.\\nNow, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will\\ndiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic\\nopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic\\nrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more\\nprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we\\'ve\\ncreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan\\'s small and medium\\nsized companies get access to capital.\\nOver the past few years, we have seen Pakistan\\'s civilian government begin to put down stronger\\nroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan\\'s\\nhistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports\\nPakistan\\'s economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy\\nsucceed in Pakistan.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

There is no higher priority for President Obama and\\nmyself than the safety of our people. We\\'ve taken a number of steps around the world to\\naugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely\\nwith host governments in this effort.\\nAs I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international\\nagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.\\nThey must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on\\nmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting\\nviolence and holding violent actors accountable.\\nWe are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the\\nsecurity of our facilities. We\\'ve also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice\\nthose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for\\nways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout\\ntheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to\\ncontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people.

A25\\nHEADLINE: It\\'s not about Rice\\nBYLINE: Richard Cohen\\nBODY:\\nIn 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a\\nleftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in\\nWashington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was \"soft on communism,\" and he launched an\\ninvestigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his\\nday.\\nRice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama\\'s\\nand a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having\\ndone - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more\\nat work.\\nAt first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his\\nRumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn\\ncharge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\\nShe had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.\\nBut Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were\\nwrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.\\nJust as surely as day follows night, McCain\\'s broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It\\nwas soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a\\npost to which she has not been nominated. \"Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or\\nincompetently misled the American public,\" they bellowed.\\nI think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She\\'s close to the president, and that matters a great\\ndeal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some\\nothers. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential\\nsecretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who\\nhas, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is\\nchairman.\\nBut the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White\\nHouse and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739841\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

For the most\\npart, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.\\nSo what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that\\'s for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease\\nabout Obarna\\'s foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government\\'s\\nalleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else\\n(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of\\nunhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa\\'s foreign policy image and the conducting of an\\namorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill\\'s famous pudding, it lacks theme.\\nSyria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad\\'s regime might be\\ndusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,\\nbut much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee\\ncalamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna\\nadministration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.\\nThis sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much\\nmore than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He\\nsees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for\\nintervention, not just say it\\'s too hard to do.\\nThe attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this\\ncase, the administration\\'s \\'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American\\npower, not merely American politics.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739841\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Sid\\nB6\\nhttp://www.juancole.com/2012/12/benghazis-criticizes-consular.ht I\\nBenghazi\\'s Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for\\nAttacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security\\nPosted on 12/19/2012 by Juan\\nThe report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc\\nconsulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates today\\'s headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The\\n\"consulate\" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not\\nconstructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.\\nI met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn\\'t even\\nclear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,\\ndepending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn\\'t been good on meeting requests for\\nembassy security funds).\\nThe more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate\\nduring and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is\\nresponsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on\\nthe consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a\\ncountry of 6.5 million, is Libya\\'s second largest city and1/1\\ne\\'as the epicenter of the revolution against the\\ngovernment of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.\\nOn November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel\\nbarely avoided death— his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in\\nSeptember. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but\\nhad defected to the revolution. Qaddafi\\'s security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of\\nhardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same\\nshadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army\\nofficers.\\nThere may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected\\ngovernment in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the\\nviolence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let\\'s call him the Libyan Deep\\nThroat.\\nDeep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those\\nhatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.\\nOn Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is\\nbeing detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called\\nfor back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.\\nStill, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in\\ncustody, with all his valuable testimony.\\nShortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police\\nstation in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then\\nexplosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in\\ncasualties.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739848\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,\\na senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7\\nprominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police\\nnamed 6 explicitly:\\n1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at\\nGuantanamo\\n2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the \\',Thai& Militia\\n3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia\\n4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia\\n5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati\\n6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs\\' Brigade\\nIt is just a newspaper article. We don\\'t know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he\\ndid so to escape torture, in which case we can\\'t trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there\\nis collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.\\nThe new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nLet me know your thoughts:\\nSOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of\\nEuropean Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.\\n1.On April 17, 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a close\\nadvisor that he is considering when, or even if, to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for the\\ngovernment of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership, Jalil\\nrealizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technical\\nexperts. Jaili continues to believe that, for the moment, the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalist\\nmovement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continues\\nto complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind, Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of no\\nconfidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead, according to this source, Jalil is considering\\ndelaying a CiOCISI011, possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.\\n2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the NTC has been able to reach a temporary\\nunderstanding with the eastern federalists, allowing the separatists to administer their local regions, while deferring to the\\nNTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regarding\\nwho has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16, 2012,\\nno decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge, and Jalil now believes\\nthey can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular, Jalil, according to a\\nsensitive source, is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalist\\nmovement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib\\'s future depends on Jalil\\'s\\nopinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)\\n3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib\\'s\\ncabinet, and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused security\\nsituation in Tripoli. However, while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regarding\\npossible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia\\'s loyal to the\\neastern federalists. Unfortunately, from Jalil\\'s point of view, this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightened\\ntension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source, after reviewing the federalist\\nproblem, Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC, believes that el-Keib, al Juwali, Oil\\nMinister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC,\\nindividuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of this\\nsource Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.\\n4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms, Shamata told Jalil that for the most part the\\nexisting fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political and\\ntribal leaders. However, since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration, it is\\ndifficult for firms to initiate new projects, since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign such\\nagreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister, whoever he is, must establish an orderly administration\\nbefore full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime, Shamata warns that his office has found\\nevidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard, he stated that local representatives of\\nthe Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of the\\ncountry, where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans, but he believes ENI\\nmanagement in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out, without additional comment, that Ben Yezza is a\\nlong time senior official of ENI.\\n5. In the opinion this source, Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI, at least\\nuntil they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib, whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address his\\nproblems, proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.\\n6. (Source Comment: According to this source, el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bring\\norder to the National Army, disarm independent militias, and establish security throughout the country. The leading\\nopposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC, and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTC\\nmembers will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are provided\\nby members of this Political committee, who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the no\\nconfidence vote, however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituent\\nassembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739878\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National\\nTransitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected\\ngovernment; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people\\nfollowing the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7\\nmillion Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,\\nJAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.\\n2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel\\nRahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya\\'s long list of needs: a\\nfunctioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of\\nmilitia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as\\nhealthcare.\\n3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya\\'s economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western\\nsecurity officials, lacks the government\\'s go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,\\ninternational advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not\\nsign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.\\n4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation\\nshould not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning\\ninstitutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a\\ndysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re\\nIalizes that due to\\npronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make\\nprogress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are\\nrepresentative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in\\ntemporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the\\nFrench and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious\\nconcerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be\\nincluded in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the\\nsame time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting\\nthere. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to\\nvote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)\\n5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will\\neventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to\\nmaintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can\\nrebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of\\nthe country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739882\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali\\nTarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government\\'s top priority must be security and that the NTC has been\\nunable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000\\nsecurity personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi\\'s election headquarters.\\nIn that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.\\nSimilarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya\\'s main storage centre\\nfor election materials.\\n7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not\\nbeen proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set\\nup a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya\\'s major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the\\nGNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to\\ndisrupt the elections.

As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground\\nin Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free\\nnation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America\\'s\\nvalues and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.\\nSean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten\\nyears ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans\\nwe lost in yesterday\\'s attacks made the ultimate sacrifice.

The Queens Chronicle reported last week\\n<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL\\nGreen/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday.\\n\"Hard Rock is the right balance,\" [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. \"Its recognized brand and quality entertainment\\nwill attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, \\'I hear there\\'s a Hard Rock, I\\nwant to see it.\"\\nOne of this group\\'s big pitches is that they\\'ll be the first to generate a revenue stream (\"shovel-ready, in the\\nground, the day after the award.\")\\nAnd thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain\\'s\\n<http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet\\nanother virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the\\nfinancial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.\\nThis is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can\\'t say I have a favorite; neither a\\nparticular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I\\'ll give it a shot and take the Crain\\'s piece\\none step further by coming up with a morning line.\\n<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-\\nh/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid\\nof $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real\\nestate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of\\ngaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith\\'s longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake\\ndoesn\\'t hurt either.\\nSL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned\\nabove. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions\\n<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain\\'s, they were\\npassed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.\\nAqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North\\'s group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort\\nand a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing\\nindifferent early on (though it\\'s original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to\\nfollow). The addition of Harrah\\'s <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html>\\nadds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-\\ndisappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached\\naccommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to\\nlist them as the rank outsider - I\\'d be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out\\nafter failing to raise the money last time.

Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal\\n<http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn\\'t be ready until 2011.\\nHe\\'d be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles\\n<http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite\\nsimply, he sometimes comes off as a nut\\n<http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> .\\nPenn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.\\nBut a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-\\nlobbies-up/> though not in the Crain\\'s piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming\\noperator with a solid balance sheet\\n<http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as\\ncompetent a job as anyone else.\\nR. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn\\'t increase its $150 million bid, and doesn\\'t have a lobbyist; good\\nluck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things\\nhave been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ).

I\\'ve followed this case\\nTorture on homefront cries out for justice\\nComments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article>\\nAugust 26, 2009\\nBY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist\\nThe feds can\\'t -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteningly\\ncloser.\\nAnd the irony screams out.\\nCarol Mann\\nOn Monday, the same day Eric Holder, President Obama\\'s attorney general, announced he would appoint a special\\ncounsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects, a U.S. appeals\\ncourt at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn\\'t have a problem sending Parlak back to the country where\\nhe was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months, shocked with electrodes, hung by his arms and sexually violated.\\nA Turkish Kurd, Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey, before\\nit re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as \"terrorist\" and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11,\\nIbrahim Parlak\\'s horror began anew.\\nSuddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department\\'s\\nImmigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working, tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan,\\na small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., tlie feds now saw an international menace.\\nIn 2004, the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up.\\nIf it hadn\\'t been for a volunteer team of lawyers, including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, a former FBI anti-\\nterrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan\\'s Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Democrat, and Rep. Fred\\nUpton, a conservative Republican, Parlak would still be in jail.\\nThanks to them, this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely.\\nThe newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati\\'s 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holder\\nlaunched his torture inquiry.\\nB5\\nThe majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons and\\nJudge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department\\'s Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose his\\nrelationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member.\\nLet\\'s remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is the\\nattorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft\\nand Alberto Gonzales.\\nThe fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of\\nAppeals, one of the nation\\'s most brilliant judges. By September of 2005, Posner noted \"a staggering 40 percent of the\\n136 petitions\" had been reversed due to, according to one ruling, a willingness to ignore \"the most basic of facts.\"\\nEchoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, a Carter appointee, writes with\\nboth clarity and conviction, arguing the government\\'s \"awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of our\\ncountry.\"\\nLike a surgeon, Martin dissects the Justice Department\\'s immigration courts and the majority opinion of his own\\ncolleagues, and ends by saying, \"I remain hopeful, nevertheless, that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid,\\noverzealous, error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by the\\nwayside. It is just a shame that, even if my hope proves true, it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak.\"\\nParlak\\'s legal team will appeal.\\nMeanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him, is the new boss of the immigration courts.\\nAs he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad, here\\'s hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture of\\nIbrahim Parlak.H <hrod17@clintonemail.com>\\nFriday, November 6, 2009 5:14 PM\\n\\'sbwhoeop\\nRe: FYI: Charlie Rose\\nOk.

I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe the\\nspecific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels.\\nBelow is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us.\\n/Let me know what you each think. Thx.\\nConsensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the\\nhistoric bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion\\nis unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration\\'s denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the\\nBush era.\\nUndoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth\\'s public criticism of Obama\\'s indecision and his\\naccusation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to ameliorate\\nhis remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy outburst was\\na classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true.\\nThe Chilcot inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion,\\nhas put Bush\\'s war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings\\nwill go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as an\\nenthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the\\nAfghanistan mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view universally held.\\nMeanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK\\ndiplomacy with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on all\\nBritish media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers and\\njournals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship.\\nPlease see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator—two of the most\\nresolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration\\nis considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive.\\nConservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager\\nto be Obama\\'s poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the\\ncontempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative\\ngovernment in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer\\'s\\ndaughter, Margaret Thatcher.\\nAnd yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down,\\nthe result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns,\\nLabour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories.\\nThe slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama\\'s Afghanistan\\nprocess, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. See\\nthe lead to Con Coughlin\\'s Spectator piece.\\nTherefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting in\\nCopenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention to\\nBrown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishment\\nshould be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years.\\nPasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article.\\nFrom The Times\\nNovember 26, 2009\\nAtlantic drift\\nWashington\\'s delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and\\nattention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that \"the whole world\" had a responsibility\\nto help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said; soon lay out the \"obligations of our international partners\".\\nThose partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his\\nadvisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and\\nhas promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.\\nFor Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the\\nNato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a\\nseparate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops.\\nUntil the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number\\nrequested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy.\\nIt is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama\\nAdministration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not\\nseem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion\\nthat it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the\\nanger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot\\nbe answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato\\ncampaign.\\nOn the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these\\ngrowling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply\\nunpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as\\npossible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President\\'s European popularity. But within Government, there is\\nalready worry that Britain\\'s voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of the\\npersistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the\\nmain pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically\\nunderstood on both sides when fighting a war.\\nThe fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions and\\npolitical options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little point in\\ninvesting time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general election; wartime allies\\nhave interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised during his\\nelection campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has\\ncertainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic\\nrelationship.\\nOn Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But\\nuntil he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was\\nstretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is\\nenjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it must look out again to its all\\nTHE SPECTATOR\\nA special form of disrespect\\nCon Coughlin <http://www.spectator.co.uk/search/authorfisearchString=Con%20Coughlin>\\nWednesday, 18th November 2009I was told we cbuldn\\'t get the South Africans to set time for call or call me back.

Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that\\nthis speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights?\\nThe points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here\\ntoo. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc.\\nIn the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony\\nhonoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I was\\nasked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might\\nliterally save her life.\\nLook forward to further discussion later today.What exactly are the talking points?What is FM\\'s first name?No I reached him.

Part of a broader Internet outreach by President\\nBarack Obama\\'s administration, Clinton\\'s Web efforts already have outpaced those of her predecessors.\\nSince taking over at Foggy Bottom, Clinton\\'s team has built on e-diplomacy innovations developed during George W.\\nBush\\'s presidency:\\n- They have revamped the department\\'s Web site (http://www.state.gov) and the Dipnote blog (http://blogs.state.gov\\nand http://twitter.com/dipnote) with a fresh array of features, graphics and colorful posts.\\n- Users can track her foreign travel on an interactive map (http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvI/map/?trip_id5)\\n- They can keep up virtually with her every move through Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube\\n(http://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo).\\n- They can pose questions through an \"ask-the-secretary\" column\\n(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/117297.htm) that recently was revised to \"text the secretary.\"\\n(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/120236.htm)\\n\"New media is critical in this new era of diplomacy, where smart power and expanded dialogues are essential to\\nachieving our foreign policy goals,\" said Cheryl Mills, Clinton\\'s longtime confidante and chief of staff.\\nEven for a government Web site, early indications show a surge in interest, according to internal State Department\\nstatistics provided to The Associated Press.\\nDaily views of the Dipnote have doubled from 10,000 a year ago to 20,000 today, with 700 subscribers to its RSS feed,\\ntwice as many as in March 2008. The number of followers of the department on Twitter has tripled since Jan. 20, when\\nObama took office, while the department\\'s Facebook friends have increased by 2 1/2 times in the same period.\\n8\\n\"What they are bringing in is more willingness to experiment,\" said Peter Daou, who was Clinton\\'s Web guru during her\\n2008 presidential run. \"They are starting to push the envelope.\"\\nWhat remains unclear, though, is whether the spike in interest reflects the revamped Web site or the public\\'s fascination\\nwith Clinton\\'s latest career shift.\\n\"The personality behind it can\\'t be dismissed,\" said Daou, who now blogs on human rights and other issues for U.N.\\nDispatch (http://www.undispatch.com).\\nLike Obama, Clinton carries a Blackberry, but she is not allowed to use it on the department\\'s secure seventh floor\\nwhere her office is. Aides say she takes an active role in answering questions from the Web, responding to bloggers and\\npushing her agency\\'s new media agenda.\\n\"The United States Government is behind nearly everybody, except in certain discrete areas, in terms of technology,\"\\nshe told department employees at a town hall meeting in February. \"We are, in my view, wasting time, wasting money,\\nwasting opportunities, because we are not prepared to communicate effectively with what is out there in the business\\nworld and the private world.\"\\nClinton was quick to embrace new media at the start of her presidential campaign. She announced her entry into the\\nrace in February 2007 on the Web and followed with regular Internet chats and Internet fundraising appeals.\\nNonetheless, Clinton was surpassed by the Obama campaign\\'s mastery of the Internet and social networking sites.\\nObama used the Web to raise record donations and identify and orchestrate an army of volunteers.\\nClinton was first lady when the first White House Web site debuted in 1994. It was a bare-bones operation compared\\nwith what is available now. Three years later, the State Department went online during Secretary of State Madeleine\\nAlbright\\'s tenure.\\nBut it wasn\\'t until 2007, under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice\\'s spokesman, Sean McCormack, that the\\ndepartment\\'s public affairs shop began exploring new media in earnest. McCormack started the Dipnote blog, which\\nsome foreign service veterans predicted would fail, given the private and stuffy nature of diplomacy.\\nThe site endured under Rice. Clinton has retooled Dipnote with a Twitter feed and a broader range of posts from\\ndiplomats.\\nIt\\'s more than just window dressing. This past week, diplomats used Twitter to \"tweet\" down false rumors they feared\\nmight lead to a siege on the U.S. Embassy in Madagascar.\\nOn her first two foreign trips, to Asia and then the Middle East and Europe, local bloggers were \"embedded\" with the\\ntraveling press corps, broadening the audience for Clinton\\'s official meetings and public appearances, which often\\nproduce more personal than policy questions.\\nOn her question site, Clinton has responded to a varied questions, from \"Should the U.S. engage in direct dialogue with\\nHamas?\" to \"How did you like meeting the Japanese students?\"\\nBy the end of Clinton\\'s trip to the Mideast, her \"text the secretary\" feature had received nearly 2,000 text messages. On\\nboth trips, Clinton also participated in Webcasts. One in Beijing on climate change generated more than 10.2 million\\npage views, more than 50,000 comments and 7,000 questions, according to the statistics.\\nClinton\\'s staff say they plan to venture further into the realm of social networking, an animated online world called\\nSecond Life, and cell phone technology. The department hopes to follow through on a Bush administration organized\\n9\\nproject that brought together Facebook, Google, Howcast, YouTube, AT&T, MTV, Columbia Law School, Access360Media\\nand Gen-Next for an Alliance of Youth Movements summit.\\nIt also wants to expand on X-Life, a mobile phone game launched in February that is aimed at helping youth in the\\nMiddle East learn English and teaching them about American history, culture and values.\\nCopyright © 2009 The Associated Press.

For others, a place of historic and cultural ties. For all of us, a test of collective\\ncommitment and resolve.\\nSome may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today. Why\\ncountries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to Haiti in the midst of a\\nglobal economic downturn that has shaken us all.\\nWe\\'re gathered at this conference because what happens in Haiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond the\\nAmericas. The success or failure of this one small nation has economic, social and political implications, not just for its 9\\nmillion citizens, but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economic\\nrecovery, political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port-au-Prince.\\nThe United States is here, first and foremost, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend. Our ties to\\nHaiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations-through our struggles for\\nindependence; through the defeat of slavery in Haiti, which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U.S. to press on with\\ntheir fight for freedom; and more recently, through the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who emigrated to the United\\nStates and strengthened it through their contributions in politics, business, science, sports and culture-the benefits of\\nwhich I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York.\\nWe are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation-no matter their present\\nlevel of wealth or current political circumstances-is moving in the same direction, toward greater peace, prosperity,\\nfreedom and opportunity.\\nWith Haiti, we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people who\\nare seeking to march forward. A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning to\\nreap dividends in economic growth, wider access to health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety and\\nsecurity-and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people\\'s lives improve.\\nToday, Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere, with one of the region\\'s biggest gaps between the haves and have-\\nnots. But in 2006, Haiti had its highest economic growth since the 1990s. It is on track to reach the completion point for\\nthe IMF\\'s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months, which means significant debt relief is on the\\nway, which will free up approximately $4 million a month-money that Haiti can invest directly in improving the lives of\\nits people and building a future of self-sufficiency and confidence.\\nHaiti has the region\\'s highest rate of HIV/AIDS, the highest rate of maternal mortality, and the highest rate of child\\nmortality. But the numbers of HIV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down.\\nNot long ago, Haiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship. But the national and presidential elections in 2006\\njump-started Haiti\\'s democracy, and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strong\\ncommitment to democratic governance, which will take another step forward on Sunday with elections for the Senate.\\nLike many nations, including the United States, Haiti struggles against crime, particularly the global scourge of drug\\ntrafficking. But reforms to improve policing, strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway, and\\na peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities.\\nHaiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here\\ntoday. And this progress did not come only through government-to-government partnerships, but also through links\\namong businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources and\\nrelationships, which is the heart of smart power.\\nThat trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession.\\nHaiti is in danger of stalling.\\nThis conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with Haiti at the helm-to\\nadvance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for Haiti\\'s growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts,\\ntargeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively.\\nPresident Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track. With these\\npriorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundation\\nfor stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability,\\nattracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a\\nwhole.\\nNow is the time to step up our investment in Haiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences of\\ninaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road.\\nWith $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five. That\\'s a tiny fraction of the cost of\\nsolving these problems if they escalate over time.\\nThe United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested, which are\\naimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress.\\nFirst, the Haitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the\\ncivic lives of their communities without fear of violence.\\nSecond, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robust\\neconomy. Meanwhile, the people of Haiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can accomplish two things\\nat once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti.\\nAnd third, last year\\'s hurricanes blew a hole in the government\\'s budget.\\nNow Haiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projects\\nin the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future.\\nOn each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance and\\nseeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact.\\nFirst, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti. Cite\\nSoleil, for example, was a no-man\\'s-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in\\nthe streets.\\nThe Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti, which is the\\nfirst in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission with\\ndetermination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region.\\nBut criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated. Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have\\nmade this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe.\\nDrug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. That\\nincludes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative, a plan\\nconceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications network\\nfor the Haitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide training\\nto promote cross-border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and sharpen the investigation and\\nprosecution of drug crimes.\\nOnce security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous\\nassistance to help repair the damage from last year\\'s storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyond\\npeacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development.\\nHaiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don\\'t have jobs. It also has one of\\nthe region\\'s highest population growth rates. Together, these trends have created what one development expert has\\ncalled a \"youth tsunami\"-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years.\\nTo spur the creation of jobs, the United States passed the HOPE Act in 2006, to give garments made in Haiti tariff-free\\naccess to the U.S. market. Last October, we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of the\\nlargest sectors in Haiti\\'s economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil\\'s\\ninterest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well.\\nBut to build a diversified economy, Haiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support the\\nflow of goods and services. The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of a\\npassable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing their\\ncrops to market.\\nBetter roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians into the global economy.\\nHaiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs\\ninclude digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers\\' training center, and creating canals\\nto help irrigation.\\nAs part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year, we have authorized $20\\nmillion in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country\\'s future. We look forward to\\nworking with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economic\\ngrowth.\\nAll the fiscal responsibility in the world can\\'t prevent a natural disaster.\\nThe hurricanes didn\\'t just wash away crops and houses; they also washed away\\nmonths of government planning for the future. Haiti is facing an\\napproximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine Haiti\\'s long-term ambitions as well as services that\\npeople depend on to survive.\\nThe United States will provide $20 million to pay Haiti\\'s upcoming debt service obligations, to free Haiti to use its\\nresources to fill that budget gap.\\n[There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect of\\nrising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to\\nmalnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity. Malnourished people are often too weak to work;\\nchronically hungry children struggle to learn in school. Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering, but a direct\\nthreat to economic growth and global stability. The United States will provide a $15-million in-kind contribution of food\\nto help Haiti as it continues to rebuild. ]\\nThese are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with Haiti and other nations. But there are\\nadditional pieces of the larger mission that need support-from helping Haiti adapt to climate change so future\\nhurricanes won\\'t claim thousands of lives; to strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; and\\ndeveloping civil society.\\nThis work is not only a matter for governments, but also a mission for our people. Here in the U.S., I have heard from\\nmany individuals and groups who care about Haiti and want to help it develop but don\\'t know how to invest their time\\nand money in a way that will make a real impact. We should think creatively about helping people outside government\\nget involved in a meaningful way with Haiti\\'s future. Our people are our most valuable resource, and their potential to\\nhelp in places like Haiti has not yet been tapped.\\nWe know from empirical data that small investments go a long way. This is something I\\'ve seen for myself in my own\\nvisits to Haiti. I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding, and again years later as First Lady. I met a\\ndoctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. Air Force Colonel, but returned to his home town of\\nPignon to run a center for health, women\\'s literacy and microcredit. He and his staff had few resources, but they\\noffered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients.\\nI visited a family-planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect their\\nhealth and prevent teen pregnancy.\\nAnd I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy. These women had attended a global conference on\\nwomen\\'s leadership in Montevideo, Uruguay, and when they returned home, they created this organization to support\\nHaitian women running for office.\\nEleven years later, their organization is larger and stronger than ever, and so is their mission. In addition to supporting\\nwomen candidates, they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs to teach women\\ntheir rights, support women journalists, and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean.\\nThese Haitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind. And they\\ndemonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the Haitian people to participate in and lead their nation\\'s recovery.\\nOur role is to support their work however we can, and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future is\\nas important as our own.\\nWhat happens next in Haiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on behalf of every poor\\nnation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months.\\nOn behalf of every man and woman in the hemisphere, from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip of\\nArgentina, who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards. and the children whose\\nfutures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control. let us prove our commitment to an economic recovery\\nthat reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere.As is often the case, I have to read in the paper what David is up to rather than learn it at home. . . but perhaps I\\nwouldn\\'t have it any other way.\\ncdm\\nbrifibinoton Post\\nNEWSI POLITICSI OPINIONSI BUSINESSI LOCAL SPORTSI ARTS & LIVING I GOING OUT GUIDE\\nI JOBSI CARSI REAL ESTATE \\'SHOPPING\\nSchool of Second, Chances\\nThe teachers at Oak Hill Academy approach their jobs with the faith that even the most hardened juvenile\\ndelinquents can achieve -- and the knowledge that many still won\\'t\\nBy Karen Houppert\\nSunday, April 12, 2009; W18\\nThe six teenage boys, incarcerated at the District\\'s Oak Hill juvenile detention facility in Laurel file into their\\nclassroom after lunch one late January afternoon. They are surprised to see strangers -- five women and two\\nmen -- sitting in the chairs that the boys typically occupy.\\nThe students find some empty seats and shrug out of their matching brown coats and mismatched scarves. They\\nare curious about the visitors in a lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind of way.\\n\"I\\'m James Forman,\" begins a 40-something man. \"I\\'m a professor at Georgetown Law School and -- \"\\n\"You related to the James Forman?\" interrupts 17-year-old Carleto Bailey.\\n\"I\\'m James Forman Jr.\"\\n\"That your father? James Forman your dad?\" Carleto demands.\\n\"Yes, I \"\\n\"Wasn\\'t he some big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?\"\\n\"SNCC,\" Forman says, seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father, who was executive secretary of\\nthe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the 1960s before becoming active with the Black\\nPanthers.\\nB6\\n\"He\\'s a good guy,\" Carleto continues. \"You tell him that.\"\\nForman smiles. \"He passed a few years ago, but he would be happy to hear this,\" the professor says. He scans\\nthe room. The Oak Hill students, all African American, are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal-blue\\npolo shirts. They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and, after sitting down, have pushed their chairs\\nback as far as possible against the wall.\\nForman\\'s Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- are in jeans and sweaters.\\nThey lean forward, intent and maybe a little bit nervous. \"I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school,\"\\nForman continues. \"And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenile\\njustice. There is a certain amount you can learn from reading, but you also need to see and experience things. So\\nI thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences.\"\\nCarleto raises an eyebrow. This is a new one.\\n\"And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don\\'t. Ya\\'ll have certain things you\\nknow. They have certain things they know. It can be a learning opportunity for everybody.\"\\nForman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves.\\nDead silence.\\nHe smiles encouragingly. \"My name is James Forman, and I helped to start this organization, See Forever, that\\nnow runs your school,\" he says.\\nCarleto, who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair, brings it down with a bang that sends his\\nshort dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose.\\nA few Georgetown students jump.\\nHe looks out over the top of his glasses. \"My name\\'s Carleto Bailey,\" he says. \"My interesting fact is that I\\'m\\nfunny./I\\nHe gives a wide smile of bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea\\nHenderson, 17, who sits next to him, rolls his eyes. But Carleto\\'s not done: \"And I\\'m smart.\"\\nBut as it turns out, these Georgetown folks -- like his other teachers at Oak Hill Academy -- aren\\'t going to\\naccept Carleto\\'s assertion at face value. They want more than good grades, more than the right answers on a\\nmultiple-choice test. They want him to prove that he can think.\\nForman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New York\\'s Rikers Island.\\nAfterward, the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference. It\\'s a hard question. \"Inmates?\\nResidents? Scholars?\" one of them asks. \"Does it matter what you\\'re called?\"\\nCarleto studies the woman\\'s face to discern what she wants to hear back. It is blank. He struggles. \"Not so\\nmuch,\" he says, finally. He looks at her. She seems unconvinced. He worries that he has given the wrong\\nanswer and tries again.\\n\"Back in the community, there are certain [police] patrols in the neighborhood who say, \\'I know what you\\'re up\\nto.\\' When we come home, some of us are trying to do right, but they basically criticize us because you\\'re already\\nlabeled.\"\\n\"What are the labels?\" Forman asks.\\nThis one is easy for Carleto. He sinks down in his chair and throws it out.\\n\"Trouble,\" he says.\\n***\\nCarleto Bailey is trouble. He is also, as he rightly noted, smart. But he has arrived at Oak Hill Academy with a\\nfew disadvantages: He has been poorly educated in the D.C. public schools, was frequently truant and has had\\nmultiple run-ins with the law. The D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, which runs Oak Hill,\\nwon\\'t release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile, but we do\\nknow this is Carleto\\'s second time at the detention center. His academic knowledge is spotty at best. He can tell\\nyou who James Forman is, but not where the comma falls in a letter\\'s greeting. (\"Dear, Fidel\" he writes in a\\nmock letter to Castro during English class.) He is a fairly typical Oak Hill \"scholar.\"\\nAnd, once upon a time, he would have been written off But today, staff at the fledgling Oak Hill Academy are\\ndetermined to view the kids\\' captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes in\\ntheir education. Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi, director of Youth Rehabilitation Services, the\\nschool opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth.\\nWhat would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman and David Domenici wondered, if you seduced\\nthese kids with content that was meaningful to them? What would happen if they had lots of good, caring\\nteachers in small classrooms? What if one assumed the kids could learn -- and behaved as such? In other words,\\nwhat would happen if the District\\'s most challenged students got a private school education, albeit on a campus\\nof a decidedly different nature?\\n\"The bottom line,\" says Domenici, \"is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming, but\\nthey\\'ve gotten the worst.\"\\nIt is this conviction that drove Domenici, who is also the school\\'s principal, and Forman to create three public\\ncharter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past 11 years. Called the Maya\\nAngelou schools, the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles.\\nStudents attend small classes taught by specially trained staff. The high school day stretches from 9 a.m. to 6\\np.m., with three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove too chaotic for study, are offered\\nsupervised housing in the neighborhood. And it works. Last year, 93 percent of Maya Angelou graduates were\\naccepted into two- or four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According to the District\\'s Office of the State\\nSuperintendent of Education, 29 percent of students who enter ninth grade in D.C. public schools and city\\ncharter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within 18 months of graduating high school.)\\nIt is a good model. But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court-involved youth -- about\\n40 percent of Maya Angelou students had spent some time at Oak Hill -- working inside the gates posed a new\\nset of challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services has been under a court monitor for 23 years due in part to a\\nhistory of abuse and poor conditions. When Schiraldi took over the department in 2005 and began his reform\\nefforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak Hill, he saw immediately\\nthat changing the school was essential. \"How could I look at my staff at Oak Hill and say we are about\\nexcellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from 9 to 3 every day?\"\\nSchiraldi says. Kids sat and watched movies all day. Little, if any teaching was going on, Schiraldi says. \"It was\\na miserable, miserable school.\"\\nSchiraldi immediately began lobbying the D.C. Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate the\\nschool, and as soon as he got the okay, he put out a request for proposals. Domenici and Forman submitted a\\nplan that Schiraldi says \"blew the other ones out of the water,\" and in 2007 were awarded a $12 million contract\\nto run the school for the next three years.\\nDomenici\\'s and Forman\\'s partnership is a somewhat unlikely one. Domenici is the son of former New Mexico\\nRepublican senator Pete Domenici. He went to Stanford Law School, worked in corporate law for a few years\\nand then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents. Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford, who\\nwas the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist. Forman, who graduated\\nfrom Yale Law School, worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day O\\'Connor and as a D.C. public defender.\\nAfter seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had, he joined forces with Domenici, whom he\\nmet through a mutual friend, to start an independent school for 20 students in 1997. A year later, it became part\\nof the first Maya Angelou public charter school.\\nAt Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights with an occasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics:\\nfunctioning boilers, permission for a college tour for a group of six students, classes uninterrupted by\\ncorrections staff who sometimes will call three-quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take their\\nmeds. Forman is chairman of the Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board member\\nof its parent group, the See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles from the other side, fundraising and\\nadvocating for juvenile justice reform.\\n\"When David came out to run the school here, it was like \"Ocean\\'s 12\": Go find all the people you can trust\\nfrom your previous mission,\" Forman jokes. That included past colleagues and even a few Maya Angelou\\ngraduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, who had been at a then-coed Oak Hill herself when she was 15 on an\\naccessory assault charge, went to a Maya Angelou school and now runs the Oak Hill Academy welcome center.\\n\"I tell them, I was here, too,\" Simpore says. She tells each new student about how she was 17 years old and\\ndidn\\'t know her multiplication tables, how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman,\\nhoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables. \"I say: \\'You\\'re at an intersection in your\\nlife. You know what\\'s down the street behind you. Nothing you can do about that. But you have a choice about\\nwhat\\'s up the road ahead.\\'\"\\nMany of the 90 Oak Hill students, ranging in age from 14 to 19, come in performing way below grade level, and\\nnearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities. They are at Oak Hill for an average of 10 months,\\ncycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine-month academic year. Out of necessity, they\\nare grouped according to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds can be\\nin classes with 18-year-olds. More than half have been committed to Oak Hill for violent felonies. Fights are\\ncommon. (Before the month is out, Carleto will get into a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his release\\ndate.)\\nThrough the use of small classes -- typically five to 14 teens work with one teacher, a teaching assistant and a\\nguard -- the school organizes the curriculum around four-week themes designed to pique students\\' curiosity and\\nget them to think critically about the nature of democracy, social justiCe and their role in the world. For\\nexample, during the Relationship theme, students parse the types of relationships ranging from those between\\nhumans and the natural world (ancient river civilizations) to those between individuals and groups (Pharaohs\\nand their subjects) to those between humans and ideas (liberation theology). At the same time, in English class,\\nstudents will be working on the standard five-paragraph essay via the guiding question: \"Why do relationships\\nmatter, and how can relationships be both good and bad for people?\" With the current unit, Change, the D.C.\\npublic school system\\'s learning standards are woven into the social studies curriculum under loose headings\\nsuch as \"Changes in the Way Humans Think About the World and Their Place in It,\" which becomes a way of\\nintroducing the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta. It\\'s a philosophy that emphasizes\\nlearning through making cross-discipline connections long popular in affluent, progressive schools but typically\\neschewed in schools for underprivileged kids, where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule.\\nOak Hill Academy has also created a course called Advocacy, which the Georgetown law students are co-\\nteaching, emphasizing this month\\'s theme. Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy \"is\\nessential to teaching them to be good citizens.\"\\n\"We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self-advocate or advocate on behalf of a\\ncommunity,\" Domenici says. \"We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that our\\ndemocracy demands.\"\\nBut this is an ambitious agenda, and Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can you teach teens to think\\ncritically when they\\'re missing the basic underpinnings of education? How do you teach empowerment in a\\nsetting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving?\\nAlthough he sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learn\\nthat one of their most promising students got into a fight on the unit or \"graduated\" from the program only to\\ncommit another crime and be sent back. \"I talk to staff about the fact that, day to day, our job is to do the\\nabsolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control,\" he says, reminding them that they don\\'t\\ncontrol all the pieces of the puzzle. \"And if you do that well, you have done the moral and just thing.\"\\nHis staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities: First,\\nknowledge is power, and through possessing it, every student is capable of success. And, absent the right\\nsupport, failure lurks right around the corner. It sounds like this: \"I think Carleto has a good chance of finishing\\nhigh school and going on to college,\" Domenici says. Pause. \"Also, he is highly at risk of not doing that.\"\\n***\\nIt is a cold day in late January, and Oak Hill is in the midst of the four-week session on change. Dressed in\\njeans, a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket (the heat\\'s not working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John\\nAdams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto, who is doodling on a piece of paper at his\\ndesk.\\n\"Pay attention,\" he says, taking Carleto\\'s pencil. \"Carleto, what is today\\'s essential question?\"\\n\"What is historical change, and how is it different from other kinds of change?\" Carleto says, reading from the\\nboard where Adams has scrawled his topic.\\n\"Yes,\" Adams says. He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the student\\nsnatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is how\\ncorrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of\\nthe room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket.\\n\"Please sit,\" Adams tells the student.\\nNot quite sitting, not quite standing, the student perches on the edge of Adams\\'s desk.\\nGood enough.\\nAdams continues: \"What\\'s the difference between personal change and historical change?\"\\nSilence.\\n\"Anybody?\\nMore silence.\\n\"Ashawntea?\"\\n\"Historical change is like a revolution,\" Ashawntea says.\\nAdams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of President\\nObama -- and Carleto accurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical.\\n\"Obama\\'s campaign was all about change,\" Adams says. \"Do you think he is talking historical change?\" He\\nwants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first\\n100 days look like? he asks the students. \"What advice would you offer him?\"\\nCarleto looks stumped.\\n\"Just throw out some ideas,\" Adams prompts. He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters\\nto the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change.\\nCarleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. \"Obama\\'s not reading our letters,\" he says. He folds his arms across\\nhis chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers really\\nwant to hear his ideas.\\n***\\nLater, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obama\\'s\\n\"Dreams From My Father.\" \"It started off as a good book, but it got excellent,\" he says. He struggles hard to\\narticulate the book\\'s themes and appeal. \"I don\\'t know how to put it,\" he says finally, \"but growing up with -- no\\ndisrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through.\"\\nSitting in a guard\\'s room off the gym on a February evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncing\\nbasketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story.\\n\"As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he was\\non the honor roll and was also making it to school every day,\" he says, beginning in third person, but quickly\\nlapsing into first. \"In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doing\\nstuff I wasn\\'t supposed to be doing.\"\\nHe takes full responsibility. \"No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I was\\nhigh,\" he explains. He, like almost all the teens at Oak Hill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto says\\nthat his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in \"a neighborhood thing.\" \"Nowadays,\\nanyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot,\" he says, explaining that\\nhis buddy was shot because of a \"miscommunication.\" \"It wasn\\'t intended for us,\" he says, insisting that he and\\nhis friend, nicknamed \"Smoke,\" were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, \"I don\\'t want to talk about\\nit.\"\\nSo he doesn\\'t, though it clearly haunts him: He will doodle \"R.I.P. Smoke\" on the cover of his blue folder or on\\na piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard.\\nHe\\'s happy to talk about Oak Hill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months.\\n(Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak Hill and tests fairly high on assessments.)\\nCarleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. He complains that\\nthe classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is\\ngetting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn\\'t say much. He says that he will be leaving Oak Hill in\\ntwo months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak Hill\\'s transition center in the District, from which he says\\nhe will graduate this June. When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First,\\nhe intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to \"the Adidas shop in Georgetown,\\nwhere my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too.\"\\nHe says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak Hill. \"She was. . . I\\'m going to say she\\nwas kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done,\" Carleto says. \"You know how they say \\'Whatever hides\\nin the dark, comes out?\\'. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me.\" Meanwhile, she makes the\\nlong, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. \"Every weekend, both days!\" he says.\\nHe is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. He has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16\\nand 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. He says his mom works as a\\nsecretary, but he struggles to remember where. \"She was working with, what\\'s that program downtown by the\\nWashington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . I\\'m trying to think. It\\'s right by the Holocaust\\nMuseum. It\\'s a brick building. She works there.\"\\nLater, Carleto\\'s school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different account of Carleto\\'s life.\\nAlthough Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in June as he says. He is still six credits shy, Jones says.\\nAnd it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release.\\nCarleto\\'s father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to\\nOak Hill. His mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrested\\nrepeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well as\\nprostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for\\nassault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail.\\nShe is not visiting Carleto on weekends.\\n***\\nBy the end of February, still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak Hill teens file into their advocacy class,\\njostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. Reluctantly they\\ntake their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison\\nyard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Occasionally, a breeze wafts into the room.\\nToday, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of color\\nare 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this is\\ndisproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has on\\nthe desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, \"Racism of the Juvenile Justice System\\nRevealed,\" to explain that this isn\\'t simply because people of color commit more crimes: \"African-American\\nyouths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained for\\nidentical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally\\ncharged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar\\nbreak.\"\\nAlthough youth of color are 100 percent of Oak Hill\\'s population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721\\njuvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city,\\ndisproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee\\ntries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares.\\nThen it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they\\'re talking about. \"Hey,\" he says, suddenly sitting forward.\\n\"They\\'re switched around! Basically, there\\'s more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even though\\nthere\\'s more of them.\"\\n\"Yes,\" Fee says. \"So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system.\"\\nAshavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over.\\nFee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons\\nbehind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this from\\ndifferent perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. \"So, we\\'re going to have\\nthree roles,\" Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. \"One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a math\\nteacher; and one group is playing a city council member.\"\\nCarleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on\\nreforming the police department. Carleto doesn\\'t want to be a city council member. He doesn\\'t even want to be\\nhere today. He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. He puts his glasses on, then takes\\nthem off.\\n\"How could you maintain better relationships\" with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carleto\\nand his partner work through this.\\nCarleto throws his pencil down on the table. Won\\'t answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullen\\nchallenge. \"Stop harassing people for no reason?\"\\n\"How do you want them to treat people?\"\\n\"Equally,\" he says. He picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be more\\nspecific.\\n\"Don\\'t arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you\\'re doing,\" Carleto\\'s\\npartner says, unconsciously slipping into second person.\\n\"And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?\" Fee prods.\\nA long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be they\\'re spacing out. Fee, a teacher before\\nenrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question.\\n\"Don\\'t have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car,\" Carleto says.\\n\"Patrol each ward equally?\" asks Fee.\\nCarleto writes that down, then adds: \"I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain\\'t right.\" Fee nods, encourages\\nhim to write it down.\\nCarleto\\'s partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. \"The majority of police shouldn\\'t carry guns. I could\\nsay, \\'The majority of police are racist.\\'\"\\n\"But how would you fix that?\" Fee. prods.\\n\"A camera on their car to catch them if they\\'re doing it -- but a secret one,\" Carleto suggests. He sits up\\nstraighter in his chair. \"And don\\'t just pull over people because they\\'re black. They can say anything, that\\'s the\\nreason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever.\" Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, and\\nhe rattles off a list of improvements.\\n\"Call to order of the city council,\" says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi.\\nCarleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. \"Hello, I\\'m Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,\"\\nCarleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. \"We have some\\ncomplaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions about\\ncracking down on officers.\" He sounds nervous as he begins the list. \"Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic\\nyouths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police don\\'t arrest if there is a situation at the\\nschool like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents why\\nthis happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police.\" He moves briskly through the\\nsuggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says,\\n\"verbally abusing\" youth won\\'t be tolerated any more. \"Basically, we want to crack down on the officers and\\nhave them removed, if so.\"\\nAnother pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard\\'s\\nwalkie-talkie. \"Time to go!\" the guard announces.\\nThe law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce.\\n\"Wait!\" Ashawntea says, standing up. \"We got 10 more minutes.\"\\n\"It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on,\" the guard says.\\n\"But we have 10 minutes!\" Carleto insists. He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. \"It\\'s only 2:20.\\nWe got 10 more minutes still.\"\\nThe guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carleto\\'s point.

She said\\nshe would seek a briefing on the security situation from the American military commander, Gen. Ray Odierno, in her first\\nmeeting on Saturday, a day packed with appointments.\\nBut she played down suggestions that the attacks augured a return to the relentless sectarian violence that convulsed\\nIraq in 2006. She said they did not signal that a new jihadist movement was taking root in Iraq, which could derail the\\nprogress the country has made in the last two years.\\n\"In Iraq, there will always be political conflicts,\" Mrs. Clinton said to reporters before setting off on the unannounced\\nvisit Friday evening. \"But I really believe that Iraq, as a whole, is on the right track.\"\\nShe characterized the latest bout of violence as the last gasp of \"rejectionists\" who fear that the government will\\nsucceed in creating a united and peaceful Iraq. The suicide bombings, she said, are \"in an unfortunately tragic way, a\\nsignal that the rejectionists fear that Iraq is going in the right direction.\"\\n\"Are there going to be bad days? Yes, there are,\" Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, \"If you look at the evidence,\\noverwhelmingly the progress that\\'s been made has been positive.\"\\nThe Obama administration, she said, was determined to help Iraq achieve \"stability, sovereignty, and self-reliance,\" as\\nthe United States prepares to pull out the last of its troops by the end of 2011.\\nMrs. Clinton has been a regular visitor here, coming three times as a senator to chart the progress of a war she voted to\\nauthorize, but later said had been mismanaged by the Bush administration. She said she was pleased to be back, though\\nthe attacks have cast a shadow over her visit.\\nWhile the violence is far below the worst levels in 2006, 18 major attacks this month have kindled fears that Baathist and\\njihadist elements could be reconstituting themselves into a smaller, but still deadly, insurgency that will exploit the\\nwithdrawal of American troops between now and 2011.\\nMrs. Clinton compared these latest suicide bombings to a spectacular terrorist attack that occurred several months after\\nthe Good Friday peace accord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland.\\nAt times, her analysis almost echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald\\nRumsfeld. When the sectarian violence was relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its\\n\"last throes,\" while Mr. Rumsfeld talked of \"dead-enders\" who kept fighting a lost cause.\\nOn Friday, Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military\\'s Central Command, testified before a House appropriations\\ncommittee that the suicide bombers may have been part of a militant network based in Tunisia. Four of the bombers, he\\nsaid, were from Tunisia.\\nMrs. Clinton said she did not have specific information on the bombers, but said: \"We\\'ve seen suicide bombers from\\nmany countries in Iraq over the last six years. It\\'s unfortunate that young men, and occasionally even a young woman,\\nwould travel to Iraq to kill other people in that way.\"\\n41\\nThe violence did not seem to curtail Mrs. Clinton\\'s ambitions for her brief visit. In addition to General Odierno, she was\\nscheduled to meet a retinue of Iraqi leaders, including the president, Jalal Talabani; the prime minister, Nuni Kamal al-\\nMaliki; and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari.\\nShe is also playing host at a roundtable of Iraqi women, something she has done in previous trips to Iraq. And she is to\\nhold a town-hall meeting with Iraqi students, as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and provincial\\nreconstruction teams.\\nThis is a format Mrs. Clinton savored as a presidential candidate, and that, as secretary of state, she has used from South\\nKorea to Turkey. \"I want to listen,\" she said, \"I want to respond to their questions and concerns. I want some feedback\\nand ideas of about how are we going to make this transition as successful as possible.\"\\nWhen President Obama visited Baghdad earlier this month, dusty skies prevented him from traveling by helicopter from\\nBaghdad International Airport into the city. He met with Mr. Maliki at a palace near the airport and General Odierno at\\nthe American base, Camp Victory.\\nThe new American ambassador, Christopher R. Hill, beat Mrs. Clinton to Baghdad by one day. He was confirmed by the\\nSenate on Tuesday after a lengthy process that was held up by Republican senators, who objected to his lack of\\nexperience in the Arab world and his handling of negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.\\nIn Iraq, Mr. Hill will spearhead the shift in emphasis by the United States from military to civilian operations. Some Iraq\\nexperts said the American civilian presence here had been lacking momentum since the departure in February of the last\\nUnited States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker.Clinton says Iraq on right track\\nBAGHDAD (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says this week\\'s deadly suicide bombings in Iraq are a\\nsign that extremists fear the Iraqi government is succeeding.\\nOn her first visit to Iraq as America\\'s top diplomat, Clinton said the country has made tremendous strides despite the\\nrecent violence and continues to deserve support as the Obama administration moves to reduce the U.S. military\\npresence there.\\nClinton arrived in Baghdad Saturday on an unannounced trip after suicide bombings in the capital and outside killed\\nat least 148 people on Thursday and Friday. The attacks have exposed gaps in security as Iraq takes over from U.S. forces\\nin protecting the country.FyiAs I have said repeatedly, I do not want to see Palau shortchanged.

The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and\\nRepublican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance\\nCommittee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs for\\nthose who already have coverage.\\nPresident Barack Obama didn\\'t embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which\\nmeans he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters.\\nThe mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate\\nwas the only way to achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would\\npurchase insurance voluntarily if the costs could be brought down.\\nProgressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama\\'s plan would have left out about 15 million\\npeople. Clinton, with an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularly\\nassailed Obama for his no-mandate position.\\nActually, I don\\'t care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care.Have they landed yet?

(New poll in Guardian shows widespread disaffection\\nwith all parties as a result of the Commons expenses scandal; 27 percent voting for fringe parties.)\\nGordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as the\\nnext day, June 5. The plot (sounds like the Tudors): David is the target, from multiple angles and\\nmotives, personal ambition mixed with anti-Blairism. Peter has always wanted to be Foreign\\nSecretary, a job held by his grandfather, Herbert Morrison. (Morrison was also deputy PM, why\\ndoesn\\'t Peter want that?) New Labour people regard Peter as more ambitious than New Labour at\\nthis point. He supported Gordon\\'s utterly misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the top\\ntax rate to 50 percent. The fallout is less resentment of the affluent to paying more or grudging\\nunderstanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that Labour under Gordon is abandoning the\\nproject for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the New Labour message. Ed Balls,\\none of Gordon\\'s closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple David. Balls is a\\ncontemporary of David\\'s, wants to be leader of the party himself, and continues the Gordon v. Tony\\nbitter rivalry into the future. Balls is currently Minister for Children and Schools and was linked to\\nDamian McBride (Gordon\\'s hatchetman, who has trashed Blairites, got caught out on his blogging\\nscheme to smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter to David\\'s job, Balls would take Peter\\'s and\\nbecome Business Secretary. David would be pushed into Home Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter\\'s\\njob, Balls will likely reverse Peter\\'s privatization proposal for the Royal Mail to win support from party\\'s\\nleft-wing base, beginning of his campaign against David for post-Gordon leadership struggle. Tony\\nsees the situation as terminal. Hope to speak with him soon. He is trying to become President of\\nEurope if and when Lisbon treaty passes. Jonathan made an interesting and ironic comment about\\nColin Powell, given Tony\\'s deference to him, that Powell\\'s flaw was being too deferential to Bush.\\nFrom bitter experience, Jonathan is wishing you well, be close to the president, and advance your\\nideas, too.

This marks a shift from his stance during\\nthe campaign, when he tussled repeatedly with Clinton on the issue. She proposed an individual mandate, and\\nhe did not.\\n\"I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone\\'s costs,\\nand I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility,\" Obama wrote. \"But I believe if we are going to make\\npeople responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health care affordable.\"\\n\"If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we need to provide a\\nhardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it,\" Obama wrote.\\nDetailing his positions on various health care proposals for the first time as president, Obama also said\\nAmericans should be able to choose between public and private insurance plans in a reformed health care\\nsystem.\\n\"I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operating\\nalongside private plans,\" he wrote. \"This will give them a better range of choices, make the health care market\\nmore competitive, and keep insurance companies honest.\"\\nHe offered qualified support for a mandate on employers to provide insurance or pay a fee to the government.\\nEmployers \"have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees,\" Obama wrote, but small\\nbusinesses should be exempt.\\nObama\\'s positions on these issues were not entirely surprising, but his decision to weigh in before\\ncongressional Democratic leaders released a single bill was unexpected. Prior to the letter, Obama and his aides\\nhad declined to say specifically where he stood on various issues, including the public plan and individual\\nmandate, saying they wanted Congress to lead the way in writing a bill.\\nBut Democrats have been anxious for the president to take a more public stance, and the letter provides the\\nguidance that many in Congress had been craving as House and Senate committees move closer to releasing\\ndraft bills.\\n\"The president says get it done. Get it done right because we only get one chance,\" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski\\n(D-Md.), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \"The letter essentially\\nsynthesizes what the president is saying.\"\\nHe outlined the parameters in a letter to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Health,\\nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.).\\nObama\\'s endorsement of a public insurance option could boost the controversial proposal and serve as catalyst\\nfor the Democratic base as the president kicks off a grassroots campaign Saturday.\\n\"It\\'s clear that the Republican resistance to a public plan hasn\\'t softened President Obama\\'s support for one,\"\\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \"This strengthens the hand of those of us advocating for a\\npublic option, which is the only way to keep the private insurers\\' feet to the fire.\"\\nDespite almost uniform opposition from Republicans on the public plan, the president wrote in the letter that he\\nremains \"hopeful that many Republicans\" would back an overhaul bill.\\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, struck an optimistic tone in\\na statement, saying the letter \"doesn\\'t draw lines in the sand,\" and \"is helpful because of his statements that\\nreform legislation needs to have bipartisan support.\"\\nHowever, the letter is likely to incite opponents, who have been frustrated by Obama\\'s lack of specifics.\\nIndeed, on Thursday morning, Conservatives for Patients\\' Rights will begin airing a new TV ad called\\n\"Bulldozer,\" which says a \"government-run plan\" will drive private insurers out of business and eliminate\\nconsumer choices.\\nBack to top\\nRead more: \"Barack Obama may support insurance mandate - Carrie Budoff Brown - POLITICO.com\" -\\nhttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23298.html#ixzz0HQhr4KMx&AFyi4Cheryl and Huma,\\nAs HRC requested for this weekend, attached is a draft base text for the big speech/FA article.

Democratic leaders were trying to convince as many as 18 of the 51 Democrats who voted against the\\nHouse version in May to change their votes, but many said they would not do so.\\nRepublicans are promising to vote against the conference report en mass if it includes $5 billion worth of\\nfunding related to the International Monetary Fund. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday it\\nwould.\\n\"I believe there are people in the Republican Party who support [the IMF funding]; they just don\\'t want to\\nsupport it on this bill,\" Pelosi said Thursday, \"So we have to do that with all Democratic votes.\"\\nShe also pushed back against two key pillars of the House Republican leadership\\'s argument against the IMF\\nfunding, which is meant to accommodate an increased U.S. credit extension to the organization.\\nResponding to statements of Minority Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio that the IMF money is unrelated to the\\nwar spending measure, Pelosi said the IMF help was a \"national security initiative\" because it helps to alleviate\\nsources of instability, such as poverty.\\nPelosi also accused House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., of fear mongering by putting out a statement\\nwarning that IMF assistance could somehow fund terrorism.\\n\"I don\\'t know why anyone would say that the money is going to the hands of terrorists,\" she said. \"It simply is\\nnot based in fact and is a scare tactic, and most unfortunate.\"\\nHouse Democratic aides said the conference on the supplemental bill probably would be early next week.\\n\"We\\'re going to come up with a supplemental conference report in the next few days,\" said Senate Majority\\nleader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\\n6\\nWhipping Votes\\nHouse leaders had planned to hold the conference session Thursday and had said the House floor vote could be\\nas early as Friday. But their effort to convince members to switch their no votes was still underway Thursday\\nafternoon. •\\nAlthough several high ranking Democrats have pledged to switch their no votes, including Reps. Barney Frank,\\nD-Mass., and George Miller, D-Calif., many others have said they would not.\\n\"It\\'s a conscience vote,\" said Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., who said he was inclined to not change his stance on\\nthe bill\\n\"I haven\\'t cracked yet,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who along with other anti-war Democrats has\\npledged to be against any war funding that does not provide for the withdrawal of troops from southwest Asia.\\nStill, many Democrats said that the leadership was lobbying them relatively intensely.\\nMore Details Emerge\\nMeanwhile, more details of the near finalized supplemental conference report negotiations came out Thursday.\\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, said that the final bill will \"in all\\nlikelihood\" include money for 5 C-130 transport planes and 8 C-17 cargo planes, none of which was requested\\nby the administration or in the Senate\\'s bill. The House bill had sought 11 C-130s and the 8 C-17s.\\nOverall, the defense portion of the bill is expected to be about $4 billion less than the House version but still\\nbillions above the Senate version and the administration request, House Appropriations Defense subcommittee\\nchairman John P. Murtha, D-Pa., said.\\nAs for the fate of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the conference report likely will include language\\nbarring the administration from transferring prisoners to U.S. soil for the remainder of the fiscal year, said\\nHouse Appropriator James P. Moran, D-Va.\\nNo money towards the president\\'s effort to close the prisons will be in the conference report, Moran added. The\\npresident had requested $80 million but neither the House nor Senate versions included those funds.\\nJohn M Donnelly and Katherine Hunter contributed to this story\\nSource: CQ Today Online News\\nRound-the-clock coverage of news from Capitol Hill.\\n© 2009 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

LendingTree®FYISorry to flood your email, but I couldn\\'t resist sending this to you from Ben Smith\\nA year later, Hillary wins\\nA year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won\\nthe primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it.\\nThere\\'s far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular\\npiece of news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to\\nbe fair, conducted within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely\\nto more closely resemble Clinton\\'s.\\nIn a dense, careful letter to Ted Kennedy and Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles for a health care plan\\nand conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and\\nwhich is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword \"shared responsibility.\"\\nObama still backs a \"hardship waiver\" for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the\\ncore of his objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem\\nmerely that people couldn\\'t afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.\\nHere\\'s the relevant paragraph:\\nI understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making\\nevery American responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers\\nshare in the cost. I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy\\nand drive up everyone\\'s costs, and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility. But I believe\\nif we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health\\ncare affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own\\ninsurance, we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. In\\naddition, while I believe that employers have a responsibility to support health insurance for their\\nemployees, small businesses face a number of special challenges in affording health benefits and\\nshould be exempted.\\nB6\\nB6\\nBy Ben Smith 07:51 PMMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD©state.gov>\\nFriday, June 05, 2009 4:52 PM\\nH; Doug Band\\nJustin Cooper\\nFW: Many Haitians See Bill Clinton Appointment as Setting Up Protectorate\\nFor HRC/WJCImportance: High\\nSee belowOk I will not suggest that but I will go back with the other suggestions and see what we can doYes will get to work on it right awayYes, I will reach out to him.FyiPurnell called Miliband to tell him he would resign, trying to prompt David into joining him, thereby\\nbringing down the government.

He has a remarkable\\nstory: born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and\\ndeveloped strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which\\ndevastates crops across Africa.\\nOutside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify,\\nand market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And\\nhe has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.\\nA COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE\\nDr. Ejeta\\'s work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—one\\nthat connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor\\nto feed their families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where\\npeople get the nourishment they need to thrive.\\nIn many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will\\ngo to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and\\nstudents to learn, which in turn stunts economic development. Last year\\'s food riots demonstrated that when\\nfood is scarce, political stability is threatened.\\n44\\nTo date, the world\\'s primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it\\nis a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.\\nThe Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the\\ncreation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural\\nproductivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.\\nWe will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual\\nstrategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development\\nPlan. To facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments,\\nmultilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.\\nTHE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH\\nWe\\'ve identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.\\n• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to\\npurchase them, and the training to use them.\\n• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving\\ntransportation to connect small farmers to markets.\\n• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right\\nadaptations for the changing environment.\\n• Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture\\nscientists.\\n• Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.\\n• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and\\npredictable policy and regulatory environment.\\n• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world\\'s farmers are women, but\\nmost of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for\\nagriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities\\' future.\\nA PREVIEW OF WHAT\\'S TO COME\\nIn the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to\\nglobal coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who\\nhave been working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the\\nprivate sector. The President\\'s conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our\\napproach, as well as my trip to Africa in August.\\nAddressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding\\nopportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture\\nworldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration.\\nCONCLUSION\\nYou can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational\\napproach: born in Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor to several\\nAfrican nations.\\n45\\nJune 6,2009 11:30\\nRooney (x7-7203,\\nCONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY\\nThursday, June 11, 2009\\nThis speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to\\nan array of global issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding\\nopportunity for women, and political stability; and declare the Administration\\'s commitment to\\ntackling hunger at its roots, through effective and efficient collaboration with an array of\\npartners.\\nAdditionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to\\nsupport local solutions and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and\\nreduce the need for emergency assistance down the road.\\nThe speech could be framed as follows:\\nTHE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER\\nYou can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta.

Their remarks about how Brown was bringing the party\\ndown were poorly received. The party, after all, was in no mood for breaking ranks and rewarding\\ndisloyalty. With this paltry showing, the opposition petered out, at least for now. Gordon then gave a\\nspeech, strong on analysis, discussing that his government was paying the price for getting the\\ncountry through a difficult recession, suffering from the worst parliamentary crisis since Lloyd George\\nand still had a program to offer. He also make the point that when the party had split int he past it was\\nover ideology or policy and there were no stated differences presented by the opposition. So for now,\\nGordon has won.

Kudos to Jonathan Prince for\\ngetting this written and placed.\\nThe Settlements Facts •\\nBy Daniel Kurtzer\\nSunday, June 14, 2009\\nFaulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner\\'s June 5 column,\\n\"The Settlements Myth,\" is one example.\\nHere are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the \"road map\" for peace,\\nwhich imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: \"GO! [Government of Israel] immediately\\ndismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all\\nsettlement activity (including natural growth of settlements).\"\\nToday, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime\\nMinister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush\\'s\\nApril 14, 2004, letter to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security\\nadviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing\\nIsraeli building within the \"construction line\" of settlements. The problem is that there was no such\\nunderstanding.\\nThe first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that\\nconstruction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements.\\nThe idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building\\nonly inside that line. This draft was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the\\nbuilt-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of\\nthese provisions, probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent.\\nSecond, President Bush\\'s 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which\\nIsrael would retain \"existing major Israeli population centers\" in the West Bank \"on the basis of mutually\\nagreed changes. . . .\" One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel\\'s retaining some\\nsettlements was predicated on there being an \"agreed outcome\" of negotiations. Despite Israel\\'s contention that\\nthis letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush\\nEtzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or\\nother areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.\\nIn his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the \"construction line,\" saying that \"within the\\nagreed principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition\\nof the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria.\" However, there never were any \"agreed principles\\nof settlement activities.\" Moreover, the effort to define the \"construction line\" was never consummated: Israel\\nand the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of\\nsettlements. Weissglas\\'s letter also promised \"continuous action\" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but\\nIsrael removed almost none of them.\\nThroughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel\\'s continuing settlement activity.\\nBut this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush\\nadministration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding\\ncontinued settlement activity.\\nCommentators also focus on the Obama administration\\'s reiteration that a freeze must include the \"natural\\ngrowth\" of settlements. Krauthammer says that this \"means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the\\n1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies.\" This is nonsense. No one\\nsuggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to\\nbuild more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like\\nAmericans, move all the time when life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.\\nThe pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993,\\nwhen Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel\\'s West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600.\\nThe numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural\\nincrease of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of \"natural growth\" in official\\ndocuments started with the 2001 Mitchell Report and the 2003 \"road map,\" reflecting recognition that the\\nconcept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing\\npolicies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of\\nachieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians\\'\\nresponsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure.\\nPresident Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no\" way justify Israeli failure to\\nimplement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for Israel to freeze\\nall settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.\\nThe writer, US. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005, is a visiting professor of Middle East policy studies at\\nPrinceton University\\'s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nTuesday, June 16, 2009 7:07 AM\\nFW: Late night call with Michele Pierre Louis\\nFYI below\\n1.4(D)\\nB1\\ncdmOkI saw the piece yesterday and had stuck in yours today.

Thank you, AdamFYIFYIFYI, Gary Sick\\'s latest analysis on Iran below (posted on his blog). Sick has independent sources and\\nis very well informed.\\nJune 17, 2009\\nIs this another Iranian revolution?\\nTo someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination, developments\\nin Iran today have an eerie reminiscence. Then there were massive protests that filled the streets, often\\nmarching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced\\ndetermined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants and\\nritual calls of \"Down with the shah!\"; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar.\\nYou need only change \"shah\" to \"dictator,\" and you have a description of what is happening in Iran\\ntoday.\\nBut there is one very big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran had a charismatic cleric named Ayatollah\\nKhomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause he\\nrepresented. On the other side was Mohammed Reza Shah, who had been on the throne for some 37\\nyears and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. On the\\nsurface it appeared to be an uneven battle — guns against turbans — but the ruler with the guns wavered\\nand the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed.\\nToday the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who is\\nnotably lacking in personal charisma. On the other side is the constitutional Leader, Ayatollah\\nIChamene\\' i, who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his\\nreligious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system\\nand the institutions most loyal to him — particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful\\nsecurity forces, including the Revolutionary Guards.\\nNeither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces, let alone the situation. The\\nfraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event, but the energy behind these unprecedented\\ndemonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by\\nthe regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered that people\\nstay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and the daughter of\\nformer president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). Mousavi then \"ordered\" everyone to\\nmarch the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders).\\nIChamene\\'i announced the \"divine assessment\" of the election outcome — even before it would probably\\nhave been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. Then, in the face of mass protests,\\nhe ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian Council— the same organization that was\\nresponsible for managing the election in the first place. No one believed him in either case, and no one\\nexpected anything of importance from the Guardian Council. Khamene\\'i has ordered peace and\\nreconciliation. No one paid any attention.\\nI deliberately did not mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating his \"victory,\" he went off\\nto a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow. He seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passive\\nplayer than a major actor in these events.\\nSo who is calling the shots? Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd, not leading it. But that is\\nprobably all that is required to keep the protest in motion.\\nOn the other side, the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being made\\nby the ultra-conservative leadership of the Revolutionary Guards, whose political role has ballooned over\\nthe past decade, perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy. They are utterly\\nruthless and ideologically fueled.\\nNew York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item on June 15 below)\\nat the end of the day, as I saw at Tiananmen 20 years ago, when Might and Right do battle, it\\'s often prudent\\nto bet on Might, at least in the short run.\\nThe regime seems to have miscalculated badly. They seemed to believe that a sudden coup — the\\nannouncement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force — would intimidate and silence the\\nopposition and consolidate their control. That is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were being\\nmade by military leaders who tend to see the battle in Manichaean terms, rather than politicians such as\\nIChamene\\'i who are accustomed to seeing shades of gray. In any event, it b ackfired and they now have a\\nmuch larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for Ahmadinejad to win by a slim\\nmargin (which was at least believable).\\nAll parties are now in uncharted territory. A significant portion of the Iranian population seems to have\\nconcluded that their social contract with the rulers — accepting Islamic rule in return for a respectful\\nregard for the opinion of the governed, an Islamic Republic — is no longer valid. They do not trust their\\nrulers.\\nThe rulers, whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of the\\ncountry, are increasingly replacing popular support with repression. This election seems to have called\\nthat tactic into question. For the military, the obvious answer is more repression. So it would appear to\\nbe a moment to bet on Might.\\nBut nobody is fully in command of events. Decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and could\\ndetermine the future path of the Iranian revolution.\\nThere is another lesson as Iran\\'s leaders contemplate a Tiananmen moment. When the Tiananmen\\ncrackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago, one of the leaders of China at the time was Zhao\\nZiyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party. He was later fired and placed under house arrest.\\nHis smuggled memoirs have just appeared, revealing the depth of disagreements within the lea dership\\nabout how to proceed.\\nIs it possible that ten years from now we will have a volume describing the intense debates that one can\\nonly presume are underway today in the highest councils of the Islamic Republic of Iran?\\nDell Days of Deals! June 15-24 - A New Deal Everyday!Thursday, June 18, 2009\\nDay of Mourning, Protests, Called by Mousavi on Thursday\\nMir-Hosain Mousavi, who maintains he won last Friday\\'s presidential election despite official assertions that he\\nlost 2 to 1 to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is calling for another rally Thursday, this time in part to honor the\\npersons killed by hardliners or security forces in the course of previous demonstrations.\\nMourning the martyr is as central to Iranian Shiite religious culture as it was to strains of medieval Catholicism\\nin Europe, and Mousavi\\'s camp is tapping into a powerful set of images and myths here. The archetypal Shiite\\nmartyr is Imam Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who championed oppressed Muslims in Iraq\\nand was cut down by the then Umayyad Muslim Empire. Redognition that a Muslim state might commit the\\nultimate in sacrilege by beheading a person who had been dangled on the Prophet\\'s knee has imbued modern\\npolitical Shiism with a distrust of the state. When Husayn\\'s head was brought to the Umayyad caliph Yazid and\\ndeposited before his throne, older companions of the Prophet are said to have wept and remarked, \"I saw the\\nProphet\\'s lips on those cheeks.\" Shiites ritually march, flagellate, and chant in honor of the martyred Imam or\\ndivinely-appointed leader.\\nToday\\'s protesters are wearing green, which symbolizes Mousavi\\'s descent from the Prophet Muhammad.\\n(Mousavi\\'s family name refers to the Seventh Imam (descendant of the Prophet with claims to divine\\nknowledge), Musa Kazim, whose tomb is in Kazimiya, north Baghdad. Sayyid families, those claiming descent\\nfrom the Prophet, often take one of the Imams\\' names as a family name to honor them, though of course they\\nare also claiming descent from the previous Imams right back to the Prophet.) The repertoires of protest the\\nreformists are using echo those of the 1978-79 Islamic Revolution-- they are chanting \"God is Great,\" mourning\\npious fallen martyrs, etc.-- another sign that this movement is not just alienated secularized elites.\\nBut now Mousavi\\'s his supporters are also sporting black ribbons to indicate that they are in mourning for the\\nfallen. Typically, the dead will be commemorated again at one month and at 40 days. In 1978 such\\ndemonstrations for those killed in previous demonstrations grew in size all through the year, till they reached an\\nalleged million in the streets of Tehran. Since the reformists are already claiming Monday\\'s rally was a million,\\nyou wonder where things will go from here.\\nThe regime\\'s attempt to paint the protesters as nothing more than US intelligence agents underlines how wise\\nPresident Obama has been not to insert himself forcefully into the situation in Iran. The reformers and the hard\\nliners are not stable groupings. The core of each is competing for the allegiance of the general Iranian public. If\\nthe reformers can convince most Iranians of the justice of their cause, they will swing behind the opposition. If\\nthe hard liners can convince the public that the reformers are nothing more than cat\\'s paws of a grasping,\\nimperialist West-- i.e. that they are Ahmad Chalabis trying to bring Iran foreign occupation so as to get power\\nthemselves-- then the reformists will be crushed. Iranians value national independence above all, having\\nsuffered with a CIA-installed goverment for decades in the mid-twentieth century.\\nThe prescriptions of John McCain and Faux Cable news for muscular US diplomacy at this point are tone deaf\\nto Iranian realities and would backfire big time, harming both the reform cause and US interests. Anyway, after\\nthe basket case to which the US Republican Party reduced Iraq, no one in the global South is likely to want\\nthem meddling in their internal affairs.\\nReports are streaming in of the arrest of over a hundred opposition figures and of hard line militia men\\nfollowing protesters home and breaking into their homes to terrorize them. See e.g., Basij paramilitary forces\\nterrorize residential complex. The Basij militiamen are said to be afraid to come out in numbers during the\\nopposition demonstrations, but sneak around at night to trail protesters and harass or arrest them.\\nSupreme Leader Ali Khamenei had met Tuesday morning with the representatives of all four presidential\\ncandidates, urging them to make up but continuing to insist that Alunadinejad was the winner by 24 million to\\n14 million votes. He portrayed the massive post-election demonstrations and charges of ballot fraud as a minor\\ntiff.\\nGary Sick wonders if Khamenei really is the supreme leader any more, and hints that the hard line tack of\\nstealing the election was directed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the country\\'s religious national\\nguard.\\nReports are coming in from Iran that allege that the regime is tracking down and destroying satellite dishes,\\nusing helicopters for aerial surveillance of neighborhoods and Basij, the right wing militia (sort of like\\nMussolini\\'s Black Shirts) to do the breaking and entering. Kindly neighbors who have tried to warn suspected\\nsatellite dish owners that the militiamen were coming have sometimes reportedly themselves been arrested.\\nDell Days of Deals!

Hope you\\'re not in pain and mend\\nsoon. Jeff\\nJune 20, 2009\\nThe Myth of the $12 Million Uighur\\n. By STUART BECK\\nCONGRATULATIONS Palau. Our little country, a group of islands 500 miles east of the Philippines, has become, if only\\nbriefly, a household word. President Obama, much admired in Palau, asked our new president, Johnson Toribiong, to do\\nthe United States a favor: Please accept, as refugees, a group of innocent Chinese Muslims. They are not anti-American\\nterrorists, but victims of human rights violations, who landed at Guantanamo Bay for seven years. Innocent, stateless,\\nharmless.\\nPresident Toribiong, a lawyer trained at the University of Washington and a highly regarded litigator, told President\\nObama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that he needed to assure his people that the Uighurs were indeed harmless,\\nand could be integrated into Palau\\'s small, diverse and friendly culture. Assuming that this due diligence brought\\nsatisfactory results, Palau would be pleased to give the refugees temporary residence. Last weekend, he dispatched a\\nnumber of officials to Guantanamo to interview the Uighurs and review their records.\\nOne would have thought that this positive gesture of friendship from a staunch American ally would have been applauded,\\nat least in the United States. Instead, for reasons that are beyond me, unattributed leaks and unsubstantiated rumors have\\ntwisted Palau\\'s act of decency into another grab for dollars by a cunning third-world country. In breaking the story that\\nPalau was amenable to President Obama\\'s request, the Associated Press reported that two anonymous State Department\\nofficials had linked Palau\\'s acceptance of the Uighurs to a $200 million payoff.\\nAlmost immediately, much of the news media took the bait, did the math and asserted that Palau was getting nearly $12\\nmillion dollars per Uighur. Within a day or two, The Wall Street Journal was pontificating against a shakedown.\\nBefore the story gets too far out of hand, let\\'s consider a few facts. It is true that the United States and Palau have an\\neconomic relationship. Palau has been receiving American aid since it was wrested from the Japanese in 1944. (Over the\\npast 15 years, this has averaged about $56 million a year.) This aid has come with strings; as the United States has always\\ninsisted that the Palauan government be ready to promptly turn over land for bases should the security of the United\\nStates or Palau require it.\\nB6\\nIn 1994, the two countries agreed to a 50-year option that allows the United States to use Palau for military purposes. That\\nagreement\\'s economic terms expire in October 2009, and a new economic package for the remaining 35 years is in the\\nworks — and has been for some time. But there has never been a mention of $200 million. And no one has even hinted at\\nlinking the deal to Palau\\'s acceptance of the Uighurs. The United States simply offered to pay relocation costs for the\\nUighurs of less than $90,000 per person to cover transportation, food, housing and medical help until the men can get\\noriented and get jobs.\\nPalau is a small and peaceful community. Its constitution bans weapons of all kinds. Capital crimes are virtually unknown.\\nSocial life revolves around the family. Children wander from house to house. Could anyone believe that the leaders of\\nPalau would risk the safety and serenity of their modern Eden in exchange for money? Is it plausible that these close-knit\\npeople would countenance the presence of terrorists in their midst? I can assure you the answer is no.\\nLast week, the Palauans lowered their flags to half-staff in memory of Sgt. Jasper Obakrairur, a Palauan who joined the\\nUnited States Marines and died on June 1 helping to root out the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was the fourth Palauan\\nserviceman to die in recent years, following his fallen comrades in American uniform Cpl. JayGee Meluat, Cpl.\\nMeresebang Ngiraked and Specialist Philton Ueld. The people of Palau are very proud of them, and of our country\\'s special\\nrelationship with the United States. Can\\'t Americans be proud of the relationship, too?\\nStuart Beck is Palau\\'s permanent representative to the United Nations.Dear Hillary,\\nHope you are resting comfortably. Please take this as an excuse to get much needed rest. Lots of\\npeople have expressed best wishes for you to me--Sean Wilentz, Joe Conason, Gene Lyons, etc--so\\nif they haven\\'t contacted you because you\\'re behind a wall you should know that many, many people\\nare thinking about you now.\\nI spoke this morning to Gary Sick, who, you recall, was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostage\\ncrisis, and is now at Columbia. He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people,\\nexperts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding events\\nGary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-mannered\\nreformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly not\\nthe Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arena\\nas a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclose\\nbelow Sick\\'s report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does he\\nlet it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can\\'t accomplish anything with\\nthe regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. He points out that the\\nfirst mass demonstrations against the Shah occurred a full year before his overthrow. He adds that\\nthe one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations.\\nTwo ideas, who knows, but here they are: 1. Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidate\\ncontrol, some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy. Sick says Obama\\'s statement, for\\nexample, was good. He also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon. If there would be a UN action,\\nshouldn\\'t it focus ont he human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging the\\nregime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias? US shouldn\\'t initiate. 2. Establish linkage\\nin negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Poland\\nand Czech Republic (especially if we plan to give them up) with Russian arms sales to Iran.\\nGet well. See Sick analysis below.\\nSid\\n5ousavi\\'s New Revolutionary Manifesto\\nby Gary Sick\\nJune 21, 2009 I 10:51am\\n—\\nL Alfred, Sipa / AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached a tipping point today, writes Gary Sick,\\n•\\nthe key White House offical during the 1979 hostage crisis, and what has emerged is nothing short of a platform for\\na true Islamic democracy.\\nPlus, read more insight on Iran\\'s election from other Daily Beast writers.\\nToday, Mir Hossein Mousavi, the presidential candidate who has come to represent the democratic aspirations\\nof the Iranian people, issued a formal statement.\\nAlthough he denounces the \"lies and fraud\" of the leadership, particularly in the recent election, he views the\\nfraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious. He describes a revolution gone\\nwrong, a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in \"forcing\\nan unwanted government on the nation.\"\\nIt is apparent from this statement that Mousavi\\'s movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously\\nin the past week.\\nThis moment is \"a turning point,\" he says, and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a\\n\"historical mission\" to accomplish nothing less than \"renewing the life of the nation\" according to its own\\nideals.\\nHe acknowledges, interestingly, that his own voice at the beginning was less \"eloquent\" than he would have\\nwished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green. But now he accepts the \"burden\\nof duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages.\"\\nHe denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that \"Islamic government\\nis the same as Tyranny of the Rightful;\" and on the other, those who \"consider religion and Islam to be blockers\\nfor realization of republicanism,\" i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam.\\nMousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote, supervised by an impartial national body, \"is a\\ngiven right.\" The objective is nothing less than \"to achieve a new type of political life in the country.\"\\nThat is truly a revolutionary statement. He says he will stand by the side of all those seeking \"new solutions\" in\\na n on-violent way. He accepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic Republic, including the\\nRevolutionary Guard and the basij, but denounces \"deviations and deceptions.\" He demands reform \"that\\nreturns us to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution.\"\\nHe calls for freedom of expression in all its forms, and says that if the government permits people to express\\ntheir views freely, \"there won\\'t be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets.\"\\nIt is apparent from this statement that Mousavi\\'s movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously\\nin the past week. The candidate started as a mild-mannered reformer. After the searing events of the past several\\ndays, he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khamene\\'i\\'s lecture on Islamic government. Although he never\\nmentions the Leader by name, there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments. This open\\nopposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented. •\\nMousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic Republic. The repression and disdain of\\nthe government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going. And no one knows\\nwhere any of the parties are likely to go next.\\nBut for outside observers, it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack under\\nyour feet.\\nGary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan.

This challenges the notion that\\nAhmadinejad\\'s victory was due to the massive participation of a\\npreviously silent conservative majority.\\n•In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that\\nAhmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, all former\\ncentrist voters, and all new voters, but also up to 44% of former\\nReformist voters, despite a decade of conflict between these two\\ngroups.\\n•In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and\\nAhmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas.\\nThat the countryside always votes conservative is a myth. The claim\\nthat this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces\\nflies in the face of these trends.\\nPreliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran\\'s 2009 Presidential Election\\nwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 3\\n1. Irregularities in Voter Turnout\\nTwo provinces show a turnout of over 100% and four more show a turnout of\\nover 90%. Regional variations in participation have disappeared. There is no\\ncorrelation between the increase in participation, and the swing to\\nAhm adinejad.\\nFirstly, across the board there is a massive increase in turnout, with several\\nprovinces increasing their participation rate by nearly 75%. This increase\\nresults in substantially less variation in turnout between provinces, with the\\nstandard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling by just over 23% since\\n2005. The 2005 results show a substantial turnout gap, with seven provinces\\nrecording turnout below 60%, and ten above 70%. In 2009, only two were\\nbelow 70% and 24 were above 80%. In fact, 21 out of 30 provinces had\\nturnouts within 5% of 83%. The data seems to suggest that regional variations\\nin participation have suddenly disappeared.\\nThis makes the evident lack of any sort of correlation between the provinces\\nthat saw an increase in turnout and those that saw a swing to Ahmadinejad\\n(Fig.1) all the more unusual. There is no significant correlation between the\\nincrease in participation for a given province and the swing to Ahmadinejad\\n(Fig.1). This lack of correlation makes the argument that an increase in\\nparticipation by a previously silent conservative majority won the election for\\nAhmadinejad somewhat problematic.\\nFurthermore, there are concerns about the numbers themselves. Two\\nprovinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, have results which indicate that more votes\\nwere cast on 12 June than there were eligible voters and that four more\\nprovinces had turnouts in the mid-nineties.\\nIn a country where allegations of \\'tombstone voting\\' — the practice200f using the\\nidentity documents of the deceased to cast additional ballots — are both longstanding\\nand widespread, this result is troubling but perhaps not unexpected.\\nThis problem did not start with Ahmadinejad; according to official statistics\\ngathered by the International institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance\\nin Stockholm, there were 12.9% more registered voters at the time of\\nMohammed Khatami\\'s 2001 victory than there were citizens of voting age.\\nIn conclusion, a number of aspects of the reported turnout figures are\\nproblematic. The massive increases from 2005, the collapse of regional\\nvariations, and the absence of any clear correlation between increases in\\nturnout and increased support for any candidate on their own make the results\\nproblematic.\\nPreliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran\\'s 2009 Presidential Election\\nwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 4\\nSource: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 (See appendix)\\nPreliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran\\'s 2009 Presidential Election\\nwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 5\\n2. Where did Ahmadinejad\\'s New Votes Come From?\\nAccording to the official Ministry of Interior voting data (see Appendix),\\nMahmud Ahmadinejad has increased the conservative vote by 113%\\ncompared to the 2005 election. There is little correlation in provincial level\\nresults between the increase in turnout and the swing to the President,\\nchallenging the notion that a previously silent conservative majority has come\\nout to support him. Interestingly, in 1.0 out of 30 provinces, mainly former\\nMehdi Karrubi strongholds, the official data suggests that Ahmadinejad\\nreceived not only the votes of all former non-voters and former Rafsanjani\\nvoters, but also took up to 44% of the vote from those who had previously\\nvoted Reformist.\\nAccording to the official data1, Mahmud Ahmadinejad has received\\napproximately 13m more votes in this election than the combined conservative\\nvote in the 2005 Presidential election2.\\nAssuming that Ahmadinejad retained all 11.5m Conservative votes from 2005,\\nthese additional 13m votes could have come from three sources, in\\ndescending order of likelihood:\\n•The approximately 10.6m citizens who did not vote in 2005, but chose\\nto vote in this election\\n•The 6.2m citizens who voted for the centrist Rafsanjani in 2005\\n•The 10.4m citizens who voted for Reformist candidates in 2005\\nIn order to examine in detail where Ahmadinejad\\'s increased support came\\nfrom, the table below (Fig.3) shows the composition of the 2009 vote by\\nprovince, dividing it into those who voted Conservative, Rafsanjani, and\\nReformist in 2005, and those who did not vote at all in 2005. It assumes that\\n2005 voters will vote again.\\nThe table demonstrates that in the 10 of Iran\\'s 30 provinces highlighted red, in\\norder for the official statistics to be correct Ahmadinejad would have needed to\\nwin over all new voters, all former Rafsanjani voters, and also up to 44% of\\nformer reformist voters.\\n1 Serious complaints have been raised about both the 2005 elections and the 2009\\nelections. Government data is not perfectly reliable.\\n2 In 2005 there were three Conservative candidates in the first round. Ahmadinejad can\\nreasonably be expected to have received in 2009, all votes cast for Conservatives in\\n2005. Here, Ahmadinejad\\'s 2009 performance is compared to the combined\\nperformance of all three Conservatives in 2005.\\nPreliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran\\'s 2009 Presidential Election\\nwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 6\\nIt is notable that many of these are provinces where the Reformist cleric Mehdi\\nKarrubi polled highly in 2005, and the government\\'s figures would appear to\\nsuggest that his former supporters have not voted tactically for the likely\\nReformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi, as many had expected, but rather\\nthat they have defected to the hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad.\\nThis interpretation is to some extent supported by the relationship between the\\npercentage of former Karrubi voters in a province, and its swing to\\nAhmadinejad (Fig.2).\\nTo many Reformists, this situation is extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi is a\\nwell-known reformist, of polar opposite views to Ahmadinejad on issues of\\npolitical and cultural freedoms, economic management, and foreign policy.\\nThey allege fraud, and it is likely that the provinces where Karrubi\\'s vote has\\ncollapsed will provide the bulk of the 600+ complaints which the defeated\\nc andidates are lodging against the conduct of the election.\\nHowever, Karrubi, like Ahmadinejad, is seen as a \\'man of the people\\', and\\nAhmadinejad is as much a re-incarnation of the Islamic Republic\\'s early hard\\nleft as he is a leader of its current hard-right. Ahmadinejad\\'s supporters thus\\nclaim that rural voters voted for Ahmadinejad in 2009 for precisely the same\\nreasons that they voted for Karrubi in 2005.\\nThe data offers no arbitration in this dispute, although Roukema\\'s application\\nof statistical fraud detection techniques to the \\'by district\\' data has turned up\\nsome anomalies with respect to the figures for Karrubi\\'s vote,3 which may\\nsuggest that they were created by a computer. These can be followed up\\nshould the fully disaggregated \\'by polling station\\' data be released during the\\nongoing dispute.\\n3 B Roukena, \\'Benford\\'s Law Anomalies in the 2009 Iranian Presidential Election\\' (as\\nyet unpublished article, 2009).\\nPreliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran\\'s 2009 Presidential Election\\nwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 7\\nSource: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 (See appendix)\\nPreliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran\\'s 2009 Presidential Election\\nwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 8\\nPotential sources of new votes for Ahmadinejad (Fig.3)\\nProvince\\nAhmadinejad\\nVoters \\'09\\nAhmadinejad\\nVoters \\'05\\nOther\\nConservative\\nVoters \\'05\\nNon-Voters\\n\\'05\\nRafsanjani\\nVoters \\'05\\nReformist Voters \\'05\\nAssumed Take\\nof Former\\nReformist\\nVoters\\nEast\\nAzerbaijan\\n1,131,111 198,417 150,235 684,745 268,954 690,784 -24.79%\\nWest\\nAzerbaijan\\n623,946 75,319 156,724 520,896 151,525 409,798 -68.45%\\nArdebil 325,911 34,090 114,038 161,510 95,490 232,505 -34.07%\\nIsfahan 1,799,255 801,635 271,861 854,867 260,858 423,098 -92.17%\\nIlam 199,654 32,383 47,865 20,165 40,580 168,179 34.88%\\nBushehr 299,357 82,376 55,169 81,202 97,412 171,637 -9.79%\\nTehran 3,819,495 1,500,829 860,548 2,424,653 1,274,276 1,345,533 -166.54%\\nChaharmahal\\n& Bakhtiari\\n359,578 90,960 87,195 126,366 59,521 128,451 -3.48%\\nSouthern\\nKhorasan\\n285,984 101,638 54,759 95,657 57,244 71,939 -32.41%\\nRazavi\\nKhorasan\\n2,214,801 377,732 956,641 638,925 527,707 656,736 -43.58%\\nNorthern\\nKhorasan\\n341,104 22,954 116,991 115,487 70,407 135,090 11.30%\\nKhuzestan 1,303,129 232,874 206,798 543,802 319,921 707,428 -0.04%\\nZanjan 444,480 93,309 94,234 132,237 110,698 150,062 9.33%\\nSemnan 295,177 98,024 65,249 90,128 69,773 56,344 -49.69%\\nSistan &\\nBaluchistan\\n450,269 47,743 93,559 117,432 155,147 563,454 6.46%\\nFars 1,758,026 242,535 334,925 738,209 403,074 786,195 5.00%\\nQazvin 498,061 118,414 102,048 188,868 108,928 168,013 -12.02%\\nQom 422,457 256,110 36,686 125,178 104,004 67,557 -147.31%\\nKordestan 315,689 22,353 59,174 251,014 54,004 211,918 -33.44%\\nKerman 1,160,446 129,284 333,275 337,502 480,271 215,357 -55.67%\\nKermanshah 573,568 70,117 137,472 251,113 137,010 374,100 -5.92%\\nKohgilouye &\\nBoyerahmad\\n253,962 34,396 72,565 53,615 56,154 148,985 24.99%\\nGolestan 515,211 56,776 129,856 156,256 155,498 358,715 4.69%\\nGilan 998,573 149,026 221,632465,190 215,478 420,258 -12.55%\\nLorestan 677,829 69,710 101,394 162,848 121,130 500,859 44.47%\\nMazandaran 1,289,257 159,291 581,654 581,269 311,949 270,104 -127.69%\\nMarkezi 572,988 161,669 89,086 200,024 143,118 184,172 -11.35%\\nHormozegan 482,990 81,054 103,487 136,459 75,601 340,740 25.35%\\nHamedan 765,723 195,030 96,988 218,400 175,997 322,938 24.56%\\nYazd 337,178175,206 76,209 150,781 77,924 123,828 -115.44%\\nTotals 24,515,209 5,711,254 5,808,317 10,624,798 6,179,653 10,404,777\\nPreliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran\\'s 2009 Presidential Election\\nwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 9\\n3. Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad?\\nMany commentators have suggested, before and after the Presidential\\nElection, that Ahmadinejad is very popular in rural areas and that this explains\\nhis high levels of support. However, the data from the 2005 Presidential\\nelection does not support this contention. Instead, it confirms that what\\nsupport Ahmadinejad did gain in 2005 was mainly from urban and suburban\\nareas. The graphs below show the levels of support for Ahmadinejad against\\nthe rural population of the province in question (Fig.4) and Conservatives as a\\ngroup (Fig.5).\\nPreliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran\\'s 2009 Presidential Election\\nwww.chathamhouse.org.uk 10\\nSource: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 and Iranian Census of\\n2006 (see appendix)\\nThis data supports the con tention of academic experts on rural Iranian politics4\\nthat rural voters have not been the dedicated Ahmadinejad supporters\\noccasionally described in western media. This is supported by the fact that\\nmuch of Iran\\'s rural population is comprised of ethnic minorities: Lors, Baluch,\\n•\\nKurdish, and Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities have a history both\\nof voting Reformist and of voting for members of their own ethnic group. For\\nexample, they were an important segment of Khatami\\'s vote in 1997 and 2001\\nand voted largely for Karrubi and Mostafa Moin in 2005.\\nThe 2009 data suggests a sudden shift in political support with precisely these\\nrural provinces, which had not previously supported Ahmadinejad or any other\\nconservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings to Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At the\\nsame time, the official data suggests that the vote for Mehdi Karrubi, who was\\nextremely popular in these rural, ethnic minority areas in 2005, has collapsed\\nentirely even in his home province of Lorestan, where his vote has gone from\\n440,247 (55.5%) in 2005 to just 44,036 (4.6%) in 2009. This is paralleled by\\nan overall swing of 50.9% to Ahmadinejad, with official results suggesting that\\nhe has captured the support of 47.5% of those who cast their ballots for\\n4 Cf.

Blumenthal refused to comment.\\nBut sources say he is filling out the paperwork and disentangling himself from other obligations as he moves to\\nbecome a special advisor to the secretary whose presidential campaign he helped advise. The position would\\nnot require Senate confirmation.\\nClinton, who is recovering from surgery to repair a broken elbow, has been building her team at the State\\nDepartment, while establishing her credentials as a team player supporting and amplifying her former\\npresidential rival\\'s foreign-policy vision. Sources close to her says she will prove indispensable to Obama, a\\npoint several Obama aides also made to Politico\\'s Ben Smith in a piece noting the relatively background role\\nshe has played in these early months. The planned addition of Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of the Clinton\\nfamily and a fierce defender of Bill Clinton\\'s presidential legacy, could indicate she plans to raise her profile.\\n(Blumenthal is probably Clinton\\'s best speechwriter, a friend notes.)\\nIn the foreign-policy arena, Blumenthal advised former President Clinton on U.S.-British relations, and first\\nintroduced him to future British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has also been active in the Third Way-\\nProgressive Governance process. A former Washington Post reporter, Blumenthal has contributed\\ncommentary and editorial advice to Vanity Fair, Tina Brown\\'s new online magazine The Daily Beast, the New\\nYorker, and Salon. Blumenthal has also been a fellow at New York University\\'s Center on Law and Security.\\nLaura Rozen I Permalink I fA9ç%\\'1 Comments?

I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he\\'s not worried about an outcry\\nfrom his fathers loyalists.Well he\\'s very young, only 15.\\nRumor is hes smart, quiet, bookish. Like his father.\\nWhat is interesting is that the reason abdullah gave from removing his brother 5 years ago is that he thought the weight\\nof being crown prince restricted his life, education and travel. I suspect the reason he\\'s done this is so his son can be\\nproperly groomed from now to inherit the thrown.

This is down from a 57 - 36 percent approval\\nMay 6. A total of 66 percent of Ohio voters are \"somewhat dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatisfied\" with the way\\nthings are going in the state, while 33 percent are \"very satisfied\" or \"somewhat satisfied,\" numbers that haven\\'t\\nchanged since Obama was elected.\\nIn the race for Ohio\\'s U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring George Voinovich in 2010, Lee Fisher and\\nJennifer Brunner remain neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOP\\ncandidates if the election were today.\\n\"The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America. These numbers indicate that for the first time voters\\nhave decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems,\" said Peter A. Brown,\\nassistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.\\n\"Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy, blaming former President George\\nW. Bush for their problems. They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama, possibly deciding\\nthat the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected.\"\\n\"Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state. One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residency\\nby such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with 52 percent of the vote and captured the lion\\'s share of\\nindependent votes,\" Brown added.\\n\"Now, by a 48 - 46 percent margin, Ohio independent voters give the President a failing grade on the economy.\\nThese numbers indicate that he may be losing, at least for now, some of those who voted for him in November\\nand should be an indication to the White House that his honeymoon with the voters may be ending.\"\\nIn the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher holds a 24 - 21 percent lead over Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner in\\nthe race for the Democratic nomination, with 51 percent undecided.\\nFormer U.S. Rep. Rob Portman holds a 33 - 10 percent lead over car dealer Tom Ganley on the Republican\\nside, with 55 percent undecided.\\nIn general election trial heats, Brunner would defeat Ganley 35 - 31 percent and get 35 percent to Portman\\'s 34\\npercent. Fisher leads Ganley 36 - 30 percent and Portman 37 - 33 percent.\\nFrom June 26 - July 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,259 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.8\\npercentage points. The survey includes 483 Democrats with a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points and\\n445 Republicans with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points.\\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in\\nFlorida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for\\nresearch.

But other emails have intimated to me a serious tone-deafness by Jones about his role\\nand responsibilities, his relationship with the President, and his relationship with younger, dedicated,\\nhardworking and late-working staff. Jones recently said that National Security Council staff members that\\nstayed longer than 7:30 pm must be disorganized in their work.\\nI speak to various NSC officials -- often at 10:00 or 11:00 pm at night. They are hardworking, racing as fast as\\nthey can to manage the many, many, many major initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneously\\npursue.\\nJames Jones is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about management structures and\\ndecision-making processes. On the other hand, his critics see him as a plodding, slow-moving, out of touch\\nretired general who was better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving into. His\\n°critics think that he\\'s just too unable to animate nimble, high flex policy decision making products for a White\\nHouse on a manic dash to get a lot of top tier issues dealt with.\\nFriends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which NSC Deputy Tom Donilon is\\nmanaging his brief Many see him picking up the load that Jones seems unable or unwilling to carry. Donilon is\\ndeeply engaged in the broad Middle East and Iran portfolio, the non-proliferation/WMD/arms control portfolio,\\nthe China economic and security portfolio, and he has -- according to reports -- supported and helped cultivate\\nrelationship building between State, DoD, the NSC, and other parts of the national security bureaucracy.\\nSome tell me that James Jones decided to try and remove himself from the \"whack-a-mole\" crisis reaction style\\nof decision-making that could rob the Obama administration of the chance to define a new course in national\\nsecurity affairs. Tom Donilon, according to reports, wields far more the hand of power when it comes to day to\\nday management and responding to crises that require presidential attention and response.\\nJones, in contrast, has been obsessed with the structure of decisions -- who is involved in those decisions, what\\nthe structure of decision-making should be, and what legal modifications to this process need to be made. He\\nlooks at that as the big nut that needs to be cracked -- and that would improve, according to Jim Jones, the\\nPresident\\'s effectiveness and chances of success at a macro level.\\nJones\\' self-determined task is not high profile, mostly structural, and has not won him many admirers for\\nleadership -- but what he is doing is necessary. If he departs his role, this challenge of dealing with the growing\\ncomplexity of national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making and decision-making\\nprocess will require the attention of someone serious.\\nSo, whether Jones stays or goes -- his portfolio will remain vital.\\nBut what is clear is that Jones has enemies and that they are trying to undermine his place in the Obama orbit.\\nTheir motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of Jones\\' management style -- but they very\\nwell could be his unwillingness to allow the liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to have\\nmore than their fair share of power in the Obama decision-making process.\\nJones has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making -- quite evident when it comes to\\nMiddle East policy -- and the hawkish/neocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part of the Obama administration\\'s\\nforeign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against Jones.\\nI don\\'t know if he\\'ll survive this latest effort to oust him -- but folks need to know that those \"longer knives\", on\\nthe whole, do not have pure motives.\\n-- Steve Clemons directs the foreign policy programs at the New America Foundation and publishes the popular\\npolitical blog, The Washington Note\\nShop Dell\\'s full line of Laptops now starting at $349!OkJuly 9, 2009\\nFor: Hillary, CherylI addressed this with Lippert when we last had an issue.\\nOur identified point of contact is Sarah Farnsworth and we talk to her regularly.

Do you want someone in drl.Nothing to report - how did mtg go?Let\\'s discuss.Dear Secretary Clinton,\\nI hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the\\nregion from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report, but the\\nmain takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technical\\nanalysis of China\\'s capabilities would suggest, and for a range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regional\\ncooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing.\\nAll best, Jackie\\nKey findings from the workshop include:\\n• Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than\\nforecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000\\nkilometers of the Chinese coastline.\\n• The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of\\nSSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan.\\n• Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area\\nhave continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka, to complement the existing\\nrelations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of \"blue-brown water\" naval operations, in which\\nChinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases, but close to the coasts of client states.\\nThe workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation\\neasy. These trends\\ninclude:\\nJapanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000\\nmiles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan\\'s maritime autonomy.\\n• Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island,\\nChinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar, and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile\\nsubmarines operating close to India.\\n• Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan and\\neven, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, along\\nwith the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea.\\n• Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, in\\nsubmarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder for\\nstates that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses.\\n• The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes in\\nthis region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in\\nhomeland areas.\\nThe report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region.\\nThe first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both, compels us to consider:\\n• The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate\\nthat their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected, and\\n• What the United States would lose if it did not support the\\nJapanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state,\\ncapable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.\\nThe second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentially\\ngiving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close to\\nterritory of a client of China, a \"blue-brown water\" clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy to show presence, and\\nto force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less than\\nblack and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstances\\nunderscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of their\\nmilitary capabilities would suggest.\\nOn Fri, May 22, 2009 at 7:45 AM, <newmyer wrote:\\n> Secretary Clinton, The Australian is the newspaper in which I read\\n> your remarks on Asia-Pacific.

They are even privately questioning the\\nrelationship. (This hasn\\'t affected their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.\\nAt the conclusion of yesterday\\'s meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the United\\nStates delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent communications.\\nWhile the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specific\\nelements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues, the Palau\\ndelegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did not\\nseriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palau\\'s\\ncomprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-sufficiency.\\nIn light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President Toribiong\\nthe next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact.

Will update you when I hear from her, and if there is anything else I should do, let me know. All\\nbest, Jackie\\nps Saw that Foreign Minister Yeo was on your schedule today. Fyi, he is one of my favorite Singaporeans\\nbecause of this 2007 speech on China, which he posted to his blog (!):\\nApril 12, 2007\\nForeign Minister George Yeo\\'s speech at a dinner organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on 5\\nFebruary 2007, which he gave off-the-cuff.\\nThank you Kishore for your kind words. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen. I was in India two weeks ago, had\\na good trip, spent nine days there. While in Calcutta after calling on the Chief Minister, I had a bit of time to\\nlook around so I attended a mass at Mother Theresa\\'s house. Very interesting gathering; there was a Singapore\\nnun there, she had been there for over ten years; Sister Maria Tony. I wondered why someone from Singapore\\nwould want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of Calcutta and living\\nthat life. There were many nuns there who were in their ninth year. They take their first vow in the fifth year,\\nrenewable every year. In the tenth year they have to decide - final vows for eternity. So if you are not sure,\\nplease, there\\'s a way out; if you are sure, then you\\'re in the room. So the priest gave a very tough sermon and\\nwhile he was talking, I could hear the din of traffic noise outside, in the streets of Calcutta. Then suddenly, I\\nheard the call of the muezzin. Now this is a Hindu city. I told myself, I thought wow, what diversity in this\\ncountry, India, and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman from\\nAlbania should come into their midst, become one of them and then when she was beatified, was celebrated as\\nan Indian, on the way to canonization.\\nChina and India in that comparison- China is not India. China has a very different sense of itself; its deep\\ninternal construction is very different. Superficially there are similarities, as there is between China and the US\\nand China and Europe. But if you look into it\\'s deep construction, it is very different. When we talk about\\nChina\\'s future and China in the 21st century, how China will behave in a world community, China\\'s attitudes\\ntowards democracy, towards law, towards social justice. It is important first to look into this deep construction\\nbecause that is their nature. Naturally we should not be deterministic, there is nothing inevitable in human\\nhistory, but when we understand its nature, it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and you\\'ll be less suprised\\nby its actions.\\nA few years ago, the Chinese government embarked on a major project which is its dynastic duty- to write the\\nhistory of the Qing dynasty, the Manchus, from 1368 to 1644. Ever since the Han dynasty, roughly\\ncontemporaneous with the Roman Empire, they developed a historiographic tradition of each dynasty writing\\nthe history of the previous period. So Sima Qian of the Later Han wrote of the earlier Han and the entire period\\nbefore that; then later on they wrote about the Later Han, Jin wrote up the Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote up the\\nYuan: The Yuan, which was Mongol in its origins wrote up the Sung. Sung wrote up the Tang dynasty which\\nwas the Classical Period. The last dynasty, the Qing, collapsed in the Republican Revolution of 1911; this is\\nnow 2007. I think in 2003, they embarked on this project, \\'The Official History of the Qing dynasty\\'. When the\\nformer Vice Premier Li Lanqing was in Singapore recently, I asked him about it. He said \"we told the scholars\\nnot to rush this project\". I asked him how long it would take to write this history. He said it would take many\\nyears, easily 10 years. I said, \"have you collected the material?\" He said yes. I asked, \"external sources?\" He\\nsaid yes, external sources too. All the countries, the Vatican, European countries, the whole lot; all assembled -\\n24 official histories, this would be the 26th. And Li\\'s instruction to them was not to be too quick to draw\\nconclusions!\\nNow Mao Tze Tung was a revolutionary, he was a great revolutionary. He overturned everything before but he\\nknew his history, he read the 24 histories, and not only did he read them, he annotated them. But he wrote with\\na terrible, illegible scrawl, so scholars had to decipher those scrawls. Then they wrote commentaries on his\\ncommentaries and now it\\'s all published. It is very difficult for the Chinese to depart from their own history\\nbecause it\\'s the same great plains, the same mountains more or less, the same neighbours more or less and they\\nhave seen the same patterns recur. So a long time ago during the Ming dynasty they wrote up the romantic\\nperiod of the Three Kingdoms. The first line said: \"Below heaven, great movements, great currents, long\\ndisunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity.\" So they accept as a part of their own deep nature that\\nthere are cycles in their civilisation; that they have ups and downs. In recent years, when you visit them, you\\ncould sense them feeling their own re-emergence, it\\'s a bit scary. In the initial years, they were lacking in\\nconfidence, they asked many questions, but now they know that there is an organic vitality. It is like an\\nadolescent who watches his own development, and conscious of it. I say scary because for those of us who live\\non the periphery of that empire, what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually, to a greater\\nor lesser degree envelope us.\\nHow do we see China? I think to begin with, it\\'s important not to try and, from an intellectual viewpoint,\\ntranspose our own experiences on to China, because I believe it will develop according to its own logic,\\naccording to its own DNA. It is growing now, it will continue to grow, it will develop its own contradictions\\nand one day those contradictions, many years from now, will lead to its own decline. So they say at the\\nbeginning of a dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full, and at the end of a dynasty, the taxes are\\ncrushing but the treasury is empty. The important thing to realise about China is that some things are deeply\\nresistant to change. Take Confucius. Every time they had to overturn a dynasty, they had to overturn Confucius,\\nbecause Confucius justified the status quo. So throughout the 19th century, whether it was the Taiping\\nRevolution, the Communist movement or Sun Yat Sen; they spent their lives debunking Confucius. It reached\\nits final moment when they criticised Zhou Enlai together with Confucius- no- Lin Biao together with\\nConfucius. That was the last paroxysm. Today, Hu Jingtao said [in Mandarin He Xie She Hui ], \"harmonious\\nsociety\". Suddenly you hear the resonance of Confucius coming back. And everywhere in the world on the\\npattern of Alliance Francaise, the Goethe Institute, the USIA, they establish Confucius Institutes and the\\nlearning of the Confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in China, not yet in the state\\ncurriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the Confucianist ditties. Now why is this important?\\nFrom Mao to Deng to Jiang Zemin, at every stage, they re-interpreted Marx. They are comfortable with the\\nyoung Marx, the idea of the superstructure on the economic base, the idea that politics is concentrated\\neconomics- that they like. But the class struggle, they downplay. They talk about the Three Represents, the\\nprogressive forces, the progressive elements, they nurture those. Now Hu Jingtao says \"harmonious society\",\\n\"peaceful re-emergence\". This mindset has a certain attitude towards law, has a certain attitude towards religion,\\ntowards democracy and towards foreign policy and I would like, to deal with each in turn.\\nJoseph Needham many years ago, I think in the 60\\'s, the man who wrote The Science and Civilisation of China,\\nthat great encyclopedic work; he said its not that the Chinese have no legal tradition. In fact, by his estimation,\\nthe Chinese had a greater corpus of legal codification than the West. A greater corpus of legal codification than\\nthe West! Surprise, surprise. But the idea that the Emperor is below the law, that is completely alien to their\\nthinking. Where did that idea come from? Well in the West, you may trace it back to Hammurabi, you may\\ntrace it back to Moses, to Greece, to Rome. But if you trace the evolution of that DNA, it goes back, way back,\\ninto its early beginnings. The Chinese had a very different evolutionary starting point. It was not in law, it was\\nin an idea they call \\'1i\\' which is proper conduct among human beings. They believe, deep in their instincts, that\\nlaw is only a means towards justice, and that when the outcome of law is perverse, then that law must be\\noverridden, because justice, proper conduct, the proper relationship among human beings must take\\nprecedence. And to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties, all that the earlier\\nhistories have summarised, are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins in\\nWestern Europe, which had as its crowning moment the crowning of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800;\\nto them, what are you talking about? For the Chinese, laws are more like regulations, means towards a larger\\nend. Their attitude towards democracy follows a parallel pattern.\\nDemocracy is not an end in itself, democracy is a means and they are quite happy to consider democracy as a\\nuseful means towards government and that at appropriate places and appropriate levels, democracy is good. So\\nat the village and the township level they have democracy, it is a universal franchise. They approve a slate of\\ncandidates, and they have fierce elections, fierce campaigning, and those who are incompetent or arrogant or\\ndespotic, they get chucked out. But once you reach the level of the cities and the provinces, they say no. No\\ndirect democracy. Why not? Because they do not believe, with their view of the universe, that that is the way to\\nproduce good government. Any more than the Catholic Church believes that the way to elect the Pope is\\nthrough universal franchise. That the parishioners should decide who should be the parish priest. The Parish\\nCouncil, maybe, that\\'s ok. But the parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? That\\'s against God\\'s laws. They\\nhave that kind of instinct embedded in them, it is not Communist, it is just Chinese. And they know that too\\nmuch democracy, invariably leads to \\'localitis\\'; of favouritism towards friends, relatives, people who are from\\nthe same villages whom we have a relationship with.\\nWe have the same problem in Singapore, in fact this problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today, apart from\\nSingapore, among Chinese communities and among many East Asian communities, the idea that ultimate\\ncontrol of the business should go outside the family is unpersuasive. You talk to Li Ka-shing, you talk to Robert\\nKwok, you talk to Lim Soe Liong, you talk to any of them; they will go back to the family. Why? Because they\\nbelieve that in the end, what matters at the deepest level, is trust. And the family guarantees you that trust.\\nThis is also the Indian wisdom. So you have the Marwaris controlling the economy of Calcutta, you have the\\nParsees, you have Sindhis, of which Kishore is a member, you have the Chettiars. They operate on the basis of\\ndeep trust and at a completely different level from that of contract law. And because they distrust local\\naffiliations, in two dynasties, Ming and Qing, no senior official could serve within 400 miles of where he was\\nborn. No local official to serve within 400 miles, so in other words, in Singapore, no Singaporean can govern\\nSingapore. They go beyond that, today there\\'s almost no province in China where the provincial leader is from\\nthat province. Now you consider this, you transpose this onto Europe, it\\'s as if routinely, the President of France\\nis not French. And if you are a German, you are disqualified as a Chancellor of the Republic. And an Italian\\ncannot be trusted to serve in Rome. Ancient wisdom! What is remarkable is this is accepted as legitimate. If you\\nare Cantonese and you have a Northener squatting over you, you do not consider it perverse or an abomination.\\nThis is part of life and in fact, you are more likely to have impartial governor than if a local boy were to be\\nthere, because he is more likely to favour those who are related to him or those who are his friends.\\nSo when you talk democracy to the Chinese, it is against this cultural backdrop. So what applied to the Qing\\ndynasty, the Ming dynasty, they have taken a step further recently in China. They introduced even more rules,\\ngoverning the circumstances under which you are disqualified from serving in the area near where you were\\nborn. You can\\'t stay in a ministry for too long, you can\\'t stay in a department for too long beacuse if you stay\\ntoo long, you develop affiliations and those affiliations will result in sidedoors and guanxi and corruption. Of\\ncourse, many of these rules will still be breached, and there will be scandals from time to time and they will act\\non those scandals. For as long as the central leadership is pristine, the system can be maintained. But one day\\nthey will become corrupt, as in so many previous dynasties, and a downward spiral begins. And it is very\\ndifficult in that situation to reverse it.\\nSo I mentioned at the table that for India, it\\'s not a country that can sustain a revolution, because its deep\\nstructure would not allow for it. I think China is a country which can only be renewed through periodic\\nrevolutions. Kishore asked me when- I said well maybe in 200 years time because these are long cycles and\\nthey expect as a matter of course that the history of the People\\'s Republic would not be written by the People\\'s\\nRepublic. It will be written by the next dynasty. Except that right now they say we shouldn\\'t call it a dynasty,\\nwe are now democrats, we are a republic, there is no Emperor...Well, whatever term you call it, it will be done\\nmuch later.\\nLet me now talk about their attitude towards religion. Being a Roman Catholic I follow quite closely the ups\\nand downs in their relationship with the Vatican and I find it quite fascinating. The Jesuits, when they went to\\nChina in the Ming dynasty, hoped that they could convert the Emperor, and all of China would become Catholic\\nand a great mission would have been achieved. They never succeeded. Some of the brightest minds from\\nEurope went there. Matteo Ricci, he corrected the Chinese calendar, he repaired the clocks in the palace, he saw\\nthe throne, but he never got to meet the Emperor and he died in China. And his tomb, it\\'s in the compound of\\nthe Beijing Party School today. And the church which he founded is still there today. \\'Li Matou\\', that\\'s what he\\ncalled himself, he applied for permission to be buried in China and he was given that permission. Then when\\nthe Manchus swept southwards, in 1644, the missionaries thought now they had a chance, \"the Manchus will be\\na bit more accomodating towards us, we will yet Christianise China\". So if you read the despatches of the\\nmissionaries during that period, the Tartar Wars they described it, they were full of hope. But not a chance.\\nThey appealed to the Second Emperor, Kangxi.\\n\"Can we send more missionaries?\" \"No problem\". \"Can we have them all report to a papal legate in Beijing\"\\n\"No such thing\". The Emperor imposed one condition: \"you can send as many priests as you want to China but\\nthey must die in China, they cannot leave after that\". You see, instinctively, the Chinese, when they see the\\nCatholic Church, they see someone like themselves, someone whose claim to its members is total. And for\\nwhom that loyalty is a jealous one.\\nMind you they do not try to control everything; they just control the big things, dogma, doctrine. After that you\\nare left on your own and you are financially independent, but on the big issue of who appoints ministers and\\nprovincial secretaries, it\\'s the same as the Pope appointing Bishops and Bishops ordaining Priests and governing\\nthis vast empire, whether we\\'re talking about the Chinese empire or the Catholic empire. They have about the\\nsame number of members in the world which is why their interaction is a complex and difficult one. And over\\nthe appointment of Bishops, both seek ultimate authority. In the end they have got to find a way to resolve it. I\\ncan anticipate the Vatican\\'s argument that \"we are not of this realm, we are of the other realm, so please we are\\nnot in conflict\". As for the Chinese leaders, their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keep\\nreligion at arm\\'s length. Those who govern the empire, they are areligious, they can have private religions, but\\nin matters of their public conduct, they are Confucianist. In public, you are not a Catholic, you are not a\\nMuslim, you are not a Buddhist. When the Jesuits went to China, they were very impressed by this - that it was\\npossible to create a moral order based not on religion but on ethics. So impressed, that they wrote about it, and\\ninfluenced people like Voltaire and the other Encyclopedists. It helped inspire the Frence revolution- that you\\ncould get rid of the Church, and still maintain a moral order in society.\\nI\\'ve talked about China and law, China and democracy, China and religion, now let me talk about China and\\nforeign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest; about which I can only talk about generally because you\\nare the experts in this field. I think it\\'s very difficult for the Chinese to break from their old mindset that they are\\n[Zhong Guo], the Middle Kingdom, they are at the center of the Universe, then there are the other \\'chopsticks\\npeoples\\' who are semi-Sinic. I think they consider Singapore to be semi-Sinic. Then there are those who are\\nbeyond that realm, who are what the Greeks would have called Barbarians. The Mongols, the Manchus, the\\nEuropeans, the Americans, the Indians and so on.\\nNow all that jargon of course is not in use today. They are very civilised, they will welcome you with great\\nhospitality - lavish dinners, very courteous words, offering you the best of everything in the house. It reminded\\nme of the way my mother used to teach us at home, we were a big family and the stranger has got to be treated\\nwell, the visitor has to be treated well, because you are afraid of the visitor. So you always treat visitors better\\nthan your own family members because the visitor is capricious, he can harm you so make sure you fit him in.\\nThose who are within your authority, you can always maintain order anyway. This is the way, in their minds,\\nthe universe is ordered. So I can understand why the Koreans, the Japanese, the Vietnamese, to some extent, the\\nSingaporeans, they feel uncomfortable about what they see as a repetition of a pattern they have seen many\\ntimes before in the past. Will the Chinese change this principle of foreign policy, I think they have, because,\\nnever in their history have they met, have they existed in close contact with competing centers of power, with\\nthe US, with Europe, India, and you are no longer separated by oceans which cannot be crossed, mountains\\nwhich cannot be crossed, now they are connected. So they are making adjustments.\\nIt will be interesting to watch how they handle their Olympics; if the Olympics become an exercise of pure\\nChinese nationalism, I think the international reaction against China will be very severe. But I think the Chinese\\nwill be sophisticated. I expect they will organise cheer teams for the Americans, for the Japanese, so that there\\nis an appearance of courtesy and common humanity. They are very careful to ensure that their words fit\\nconditions today.\\nBut let me say in their defence that many of these methods they use arise out of fear, not out of a desire to\\ndominate. If you analyse the old tributary system, those who sent tributes got more than they gave in return. It\\nbecame a racket. So the Japanese merchants competed to get tokens from [Ryukyu] in order to be able to do the\\nChina trade because it meant a lot of money. The Chinese are fearful of foreigners. They are fearful of the\\nRussians to the north, the Muslims to the West, the Indians across the Himalayas, but mostly the Americans\\nacross the Pacific. Their strategy is to keep the temperature low, low profile, hide the shine of your armour, the\\nshine of your sword, just play the game and concentrate on economic development. Internally will they make\\npreparations? I have no doubt, because they have a deep fear. Is their intention to dominate, to conquer, the way\\nthe European powers did in the past? I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think there is a great desire to turn non-Chinese\\ninto Chinese. Maybe Korea, maybe Vietnam, maybe Mongolia, who at various points in time were part of their\\ngreater empire, they might consider worth civilising. But beyond that, Sinicising Indians, Russians? No, I don\\'t\\nthink they will want to do that. So as they now become stronger and more powerful, I believe that while their\\nold nature will re-assert itself, they will also be reacting to us. If they find the world a threatening place, they\\nwill develop their own responses to those threats.\\nQuite early in the day, they wanted to neutralise Southeast Asia, Asean. It had never been an area which\\nthreatened them, historically. So they didn\\'t worry about Southeast Asia as a threat. But resources, sea lanes,\\nthey go through Southeast Asia. And they made a dramatic move a few years ago. Zhu Rongji was here for the\\nASEAN-China summit. He said, \"free trade agreement\". At that time when he announced it, the leaders of\\nASEAN almost fell off their chairs. We thought of China an economic threat to us. Not as a partner. Took us\\nalmost a year to digest the implications and to say yes, let\\'s negotiate. Step by step. And all the time China was\\nassuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit. When the Framework Agreement was signed\\nby Zhu Rongji in 2002 in Phonm Penh, he made two remarkable statements. He said if after 10 years, the\\nagreement benefits China more than it benefits Southeast Asia, let us renegotiate it. I can never imagine the\\nAmerican USTR, or the European Trade Commissioner, talking like that. I mean in a contract, a deal is a deal,\\nit\\'s settled for eternity. Then he said: \"China does not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia\", so\\nhe acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl, we intended to be promiscuous from the\\nbeginning. Towards Northeast Asia, I think it is very complicated, because there is so much history and legacy.\\nTowards Central Asia, towards Russia, they have deep fears. Towards America, it has become a relationship\\nbound together at so many points, a rupture would become more and more unthinkable. But it is going to be a\\nvery difficult relationship, it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in this\\ncentury. If it\\'s badly managed there will be war, if it\\'s properly managed there will be another generation of\\npeace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty. In this area,\\nyou are the experts, but whenever I see China and watch its moves, I go back to its deep nature because it\\'s not\\neasy for a country so vast, with such a sense of itself, to depart too much from its deep nature.

Sid\\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/12/david-miliband-gordon-brown-labour-leadership/print\\nThe Guardian\\nDavid Miliband: Labour is facing the fight of its life\\nForeign secretary thought about quitting the government in last week\\'s turmoil\\nDavid Miliband expressed his frustration at a lack of vision from the Labour leadership. Photograph: Martin\\nGodwin\\nVoters still don\\'t know what Labour and Gordon Brown stand for, David Miliband admits today, as he reveals\\nhow close he came to quitting the government during last week\\'s turmoil at Westminster.\\nSpeaking to the Guardian at the end of 10 extraordinary days, the foreign secretary says the party\\'s high\\ncommand was given an \"electric shock\" by the disastrous European election results, and he urges fellow\\nministers to get out and prepare for \"the fight of our life\".\\nBut Miliband also concedes that he considered following his close friend and ally James Purnell, who resigned\\nfrom the government last week and called for the prime minister to stand down.\\nMiliband said: \"I\\'d made my decision on Thursday. Sometimes you can make your decisions with great\\nplanning and calculation and sometimes you have to make them rather more quickly. James made his decision\\nin good faith, I made my decision in good faith ... we all have tolive with our decisions.\"\\nThe Labour party has a settled view of who should be leader, he said. \"This divides people who are close and\\npeople feel passionately one way and people feel passionately the other way.\"\\nDescribing the task now facing Labour, he says: \"It could not be more urgent that there is a maximum of 11\\nmonths until the next general election, that we got 15% of the vote nationally [last week], that we came second\\nin Wales and that one in 20 people voted for us. If that does not electric shock us out of our ministerial chairs to\\nthink: \\'By God, we have got the fight of our life on our hands because whatever the Tories are they certainly\\ndon\\'t deserve a landslide\\' — then nothing will.\"\\nMiliband has not given a domestic policy interview for nearly nine months since he felt dogged by accusations\\nthat he was manoeuvring for the premiership. He refuses to acknowledge that his decision to back Brown last\\nweek saved the prime minister, saying \"it is impossible to tell\".\\nBut the foreign secretary feels his loyalty has given him the freedom to speak his mind without his motives\\nbeing questioned by anyone in Downing Street.\\nMiliband betrays frustration at the absence of a clear Labour vision, saying: \"We need the message to go out\\nthat we have got the humility to learn about what has gone wrong.\\n\"It is not a masochism strategy. It is about saying what we believe in. It is about clarity, priority, adding up to\\npurpose. I know what we stand for, I know what our instincts are, but the voters don\\'t. Actually, I know what\\nGordon Brown stands for.\\n\"We have a responsibility to make sure that, come the election, [voters] know what Labour stands for. We were\\nnot being listened to, people felt that they had been forgotten, we neither inspired nor reassured.\"\\nHe calls for cabinet colleagues to show stronger leadership in the battle to restore Labour\\'s fortunes. \"We need\\nto make sure the talents and energies of not just the whole of the cabinet, but the whole of the labour movement\\nare give n free rein because one in 20 people voted for us. The truth is that we are not automatons. We all have\\nto get out there.\"\\nAsked whether he felt voters had stopped listening to Brown, Miliband said: \"He himself has said he has to\\nbuild on his strengths and work on his weaknesses. That is a good maxim for all of us. He is someone who\\nmade the right decisions on the biggest issue of the day. We have got a chance to fight with honour and dignity\\nfor what we believe in. The stakes are very high because we know that parties can slump into very dangerous\\npositions.\"\\nProviding what he describes as a route map from the disaster, he said: \"Labour first needs a period of\\ncompetent, effective, stable government; secondly, we need to reset our political compass so ministers are no\\nlonger locked in their departments, but link their policies to their values; and thirdly, the government has to be\\nat the cutting edge of policy.\"\\nOn the issue of political reform, he demands a speeding-up of the pace of political reform, saying it is not a\\npiece of middle-class frippery. For the first time, he reveals that he now backs the Alternative Vote for the\\nCommons, saying MPs\\' legitimacy will be strengthened by being able to say 50% in my constituency voted for\\nme.\\nHe says the change cannot be made before the general election. He also backs a fresh push on Lords reform,\\nsaying \"we have got an agreed blueprint\".\\nHe rounded on Tory spending plans, but said Labour would clarify its own intentions before the election. \"They\\nwill be credible and clear. We will come to that in an open and honest way.\"\\nBut he defends delay in setting out these figures, arguing \"when you are in the middle of a Tornado it is a bad\\ntime take a forecast\".\\nIn an oblique reference to the Damian McBride briefings, he also calls on the media to abandon unattributable\\nbriefings, saying all politicians\\' spokesmen should be named, or not quoted by media outlets. \"The gotcha\\nculture of politics is not in anyone\\'s interests,\" he said.\\nShop Dell\\'s full line of Laptops now starting at $349!No news\\nrichard asked you talk to you tonite.Are you calling me?H <hrod17@clintonemail.com>\\nSaturday, December 26, 2009 1:16 PM\\n\\'abedinh@state.gov\\'\\nRe: (Reuters) Taliban Planned to Use Americans In Pakistan Attacks\\nB6B6B6H <hrod17@clintonemail.com>\\nMonday, December 28, 2009 10:59 AM\\n\\'cheryl.mills@ \\'PosnerMH@state.gov\\'; \\'daniel.baer@\\n\\'sullivanjj@state.gov\\'\\n\\'crowleypj@state.gov\\'; \\'preines@\\nWPost editorial\\nI thought the argument they made yesterday about the human rights speech was either deliberately obtuse or clueless.\\nEither way, we need to respond and refute.

In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.\\nMrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she\\naddressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and\\nenormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.\\n\"This is possible,\" she said. \"You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.\"\\nKenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of\\nAfrica\\'s most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to\\nprosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the\\nSouth African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.\\nIn Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many\\ninroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was\\npassionate about the need to end the nation\\'s rape epidemic.\\n\"The secretary\\'s visit to the heart of the world\\'s deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for\\nthat conflict,\" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. \"Her commitment to\\naddressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the\\nusual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.\"\\n\"Now,\" he added, \"comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations\\nengendered by her visit.\"\\nIn Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country\\'s president, Ellen Johnson\\nSirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.\\nThe Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th\\ncentury by freed American slaves, and the country\\'s flag, the people\\'s names and even the police uniforms with plastic-\\nbrimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant\\nwelcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud\\nfunny noises whenever she said something striking.\\n\"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,\" she said.\\nIn Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country\\nthat included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the\\nturmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in\\nCanctIn or the Bahamas.\\nMrs. Clinton called Cape Verde \"a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.\"\\nOn Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, \"I bring you greetings from President Obama.\"\\nShe called him a \"son of Africa\" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to\\nhelp Africa reach its promise.\\n###Importance: HighImportance:\\nAbedin, Huma <AbedinH@state.gov>\\nSaturday, August 15, 2009 9:39 AM\\nH\\nFw: Burma: CODEL Webb meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi\\nHigh\\n- Declassify on: 08/14/2024I think yes.PIR <\\nSaturday, August 15, 2009 10:28 AM\\nH\\nRe: AAR\\nShe painted a very positive portrait of the trip, and said that nothing knocked you off stride, you staved focused.\\nI\\'m just reading the clips now and the wrap up pieces are uniformly terrific.

And the reaction I have heard today has been very\\npositive.\\nLet raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as\\nI understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are\\ntwo ways:\\n1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a\\nhandful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would\\nrepresent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it\\nwould trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about\\nour effectiveness.\\n2. The alternative would be for the administration to say:\\na. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a\\nsettlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.\\nb. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of\\nhousing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we\\nhave expressed to them..\\n•c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants\\nan immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help\\npromote a two-state solution.\\nThis latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to move\\nforward.\\nOf course, I am around if you want to discuss.\\nGood luck in India.

The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands\\'\\ndevelopment. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau\\'s long-term economic\\ndevelopment.\\nA Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua\\nKoshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador\\nto the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July\\n8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office\\nof Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of\\nthe Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.\\nThe U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of\\nthe U.S. delegation\\'s statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well\\nas the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau\\'s economic situation and fiscal responsibility\\ncommitments, and Palau\\'s contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the\\nU.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau\\'s strategic location and posture, and Palau\\'s positions in\\nthe U.N.\\nPalau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact,\\ndeepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive\\nexpressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political\\nparties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to\\npositions befitting the great nation that is the United States.\\nRecognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that\\nthe U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officials\\ncan be needed.\\nBecause of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive to\\nelaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau\\'s representatives are confining additional comment to\\nofficial communications.\\nB6FYI\\nMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nTuesday, July 21, 2009 3:28 PM\\nSullivan, Jacob J; Abedin, Huma; H\\nFW: GomaPer our conversation\\nMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nTuesday, July 21, 2009 5:37 PM\\nH\\nFW: Ex-U.S. Diplomat Talks With HamasFyi\\nMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nTuesday, August 18, 2009 8:56 PM\\nH\\nFw: Good news from japan newtRemind me to discuss this with you.Is on board.\\nI also spoke to ams so he is at our disposal.\\nAre there matters you want me to get him started?Sullivan, Jacob J<Sullivan11@state.gov>\\nWednesday, August 19, 2009 7:59 AM\\nH\\nGood morning -- I realized yesterday to my chagrin that I did not discuss with you taking a few days off.

Although exact\\nnumbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with\\nover 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was\\nexploded in front of the main gate. Zebari\\'s Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40\\ninjuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to\\nhold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who\\'s\\nwife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may\\nhave lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or\\nwounded in the attack.I already told them to plan on calling chris hill first. So let me start the process.

We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,\" Japan\\'s Kyodo news agency\\nquoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in\\nNew York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan,\\nChina and Russia, saying \"the six-party talks are gone forever.\" The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within\\nthe six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last\\nweekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North\\nKorea and the U.S. were slim. \"Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective\\napproach\" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks \"cheated\"\\nNorth Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more\\ndetails were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the\\nU.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket\\nlaunch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range\\nmissile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing\\ninternational condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea\\'s\\nnuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. \"North Korea will\\nbe a significant topic, but obviously one among many,\" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in\\nWashington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State\\nHillary Rodham Clinton\\'s recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to \"small children\" demanding attention. At\\na regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North \"has no friends left.\" North Korea\\'s Foreign\\nMinistry described her Thursday as \"a funny lady\" who sometimes \"looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a\\npensioner going shopping.\"\\n298YesNo word back from kristy but I told her 7am Karine and barbara will be there at 7:15.\\nCall reminders: holbrooke and moratinos.\\n79QTom shannon passed on the below points:\\nThe Honduran Armed Forces released a statement late last evening.

Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and\\ntwo nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were\\nfound innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to\\nmake abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya\\nhas one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking\\nthe procedure, often through dangerous means.\\nKenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution\\nby next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which\\nwould codify that \"life begins at conception\". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal\\npersonhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a\\nprovision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African\\nUnion\\'s Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and\\nreproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain\\nthe momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a\\nregression for women\\'s rights and for the country writ large.\\nI went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional\\namendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and\\nproviders in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post\\nabortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don\\'t need to tell you\\nhow poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government\\nharassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe\\nmedical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue\\nwhen you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that\\nif Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be\\nhappy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also\\na Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side\\nmeeting on this issue as well.\\nAs always, thank you so much for all you do.

As briefly\\ndiscussed in the meeting today, the LGF operate at what I would consider the \"Threshold\\'\\nSleep Deprivation. Further meaning, that our work schedule, hours and sleeping pattern\\'\\nthe LGF very close to the edge of serious sleep deprivation. When we have to work go.,\\n,\\ntime or ramp up extra manpower (during scheduled off days) due to increased threw .\\netc...etc...; we further compound the issue of sleep deprivation. This ultimately dirninit,:\\nLGF\\'s ability to provide security.\\nTo better explain, here is where it starts, the LGF work 3 days then transition (swing shift) into .\\nnights then transition into 3 days off (it used to be 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-)\\nof work; Supervisor\\'s can average up to 15 hours per work day.\\nSnap shot of an average day for a shift:\\n1. 05:00hrs every day, Shift Brief for on-going shift, along with \"In-Service Training\". .I\\nConvoy Brief, followed by convoy load time and organization for entire shift (approx i\\nduring the day) followed by actual convoy movement.\\n2. 05:45 to 06:15hrs. (approximately) you have the shift change over on site,\\n3. 06:15 to 17:45, regular work day on site.\\n4. 17:45 to 18:15, Shift change over, followed by reorganization of convoy for off-going. slii\\nthen actual convoy movement\\n5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns to Camp Sullivan, weapons and equipment are\\ndown loaded and convoy equipment is stowed, vehicle\\'s re-staged in parking lot.\\n6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift is complete, all equipment is accounted for and\\nsecured, they are then on personnel time whether to work out and train, eat dinner, watch\\nmovie, internet, phone calls, sleep or etc.\\n7. 10 hours later, it starts all over with a 05:00hrs Shift Brief not taking into considers tit\\nwake-up and grooming and breakfast.\\nThis averages an actual 14 hour day for each LGF member. Some days can be as short a,\\nhours and some days as long as 14.5 hours. Supervisor\\'s can average an additional\\n(approximate) 30 minutes prior to and after a shift conducting administrative duties and or ,;1\\norganization. All personal hygiene, laundry, personal e-mail/matters, Physical fitness, usually\\nmeals and sleep must be conducted within the 10 hour window between an individual\\'s shifts.\\nAfter completing the 3 days in a work cycle which ends at 19:00hrs, the shifts swings into\\nnight shift schedule. Their next duty starts at 17:00hrs the following day for the evening\\nbriefmg. This is a 22 hour transition window which most LGF only sleep once and are\\nagain with the same 14 hour schedule for their first night shift. This can be viewed as gea i\\none good sleep in for a 36 hours window of time (by the end of their first night shift, fol\\ntwo more night shifts).\\nWhen finishing their last night shift, they are immediately off, however, do to working ah\\n(arriving back at Camp Sullivan around 06:30) they sleep most of the first day off. They the\\nhave to adjust back into a night-time sleeping pattern. The second day off is a designated\\ntraining day. Third day is a scheduled off day.\\nIf you average this work schedule out over the course of a month, an LGF member transitio\\',\\nfrom a day to night sleeping pattern on average of 7 times. It\\'s nearly impossible to establish\\nrhythmic sleeping pattern. This is what causes the sleep deprivation. You can see its efftiek\\nover the course of time. When a shift gets back on ground after an R&R, they are fresh and rt,\\nof energy, as compared to a shift that is been in the grind for 7 or 8 weeks and sometint,:..\\nafter 5 and 6 weeks.\\nIn summary, a disruption or addition to the current work schedule further compounds t1.\\nsleep deprivation and is not sustainable by the LGF for extended periods of time.\\nRespectfully, Werner The\\nGuard Force Commander US Embassy, Kabul Afghanistan\\nArmorGroup North America\\nTel: (+93) 0777715903 (+93) 0799715903\\nilicstate.gov orCan you call me on cell after 10:30 am?

We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ\\nBEGIN TEXT\\nQuestions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United\\nNations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,\\nshe said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.\\nRegarding the Secretary\\'s reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult\\nconflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this\\ndecade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and\\nsexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was\\nthe basis for the Secretary\\'s statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,\\nthough we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of\\ndetainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in\\nother conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.\\nThese questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the\\nmilitary conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the\\npromotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000\\ndisplaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The\\nUnited States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.I am and would love to see you and/or melanne.

As you know, as chief of US\\nmission to UN in Afghanistan he has protested the election fraud and come into conflict with the head\\nof UN there, who wanted to cover it up. Peter has just come out of Afghanistan after four solid months\\nthere. He is pessimistic, says the analogy to Vietnam is not wrong-headed, that comparisons of\\nincreasing troop levels there as though the surge in Iraq could be replicated are misguided, but thinks\\nthere is an approach that should be attempted that involves the vote recount and trying to replace\\nKarzai. He wishes to speak with you directly. He says that he has difficulty communicating with\\nHolbrooke, not because he can\\'t reach him, but because he finds Dick disjointed these days. Peter is\\non a plane right now to Norway, then London, then to NY on Wed, then could go to DC. He says you\\ncan reach him through the US mission to the UN office. FYI, from Wash Post today:\\n\"The issue of how seriously to take the fraud charges, and whether to force a runoff, has also caused a rare\\npublic rift within the international community here. The senior American official at the U.N. mission, Peter W.\\nGalbraith, left the country abruptly Sunday in a dispute with the mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide.\\n\"Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe. Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorized\\nto. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because it\\ncould undermine national stability.\\nGalbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number of\\npolling stations in some areas in the south, the incumbent\\'s ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide\\nand others, the source said, were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities could\\nbe smoothed over, as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin.\"\\nAnd, I\\'ve included below Jane Smiley\\'s rave review of Max\\'s book.\\nSid\\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah_b290293.html\\nYour request is being processed...\\nJane Smiley\\nPulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and Essayist\\nPosted: September 17, 2009 02:56 PM\\nHuffPost Book Review: Republican Gomorrah\\nAbout twenty years ago, I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store.\\nThe way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gun\\nwent off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn\\'t in fact his fault. He never said, \"I shot a\\nman.\" It just happened.\\nI thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal\\'s terrific, but also, of course, appalling new book,\\nRepublican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn\\'t a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican party\\nwho does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No Republican is an agent of his or her own\\nsuccess or failure, sin or redemption. It just happens.\\nThe consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats, guns at rallies,\\nunhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn\\'t feel the way he or she wants to feel, absolute sense of\\npowerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about the\\nmurderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments, the clerk knew it. But the killer, no matter\\nhow well armed, never felt it.\\nRepublican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the various\\nRepublican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing.\\nThey invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, and\\ndamning others who either don\\'t accept their beliefs or don\\'t acknowledge their power and righteousness. Of\\ncourse that is frightening.\\nBut Blumenthal\\'s cast of characters, beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son, Ryan, and including John\\nHagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al.\\nstrike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, and resentful.\\nEach of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even those\\nof us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about the\\npower that they wish to exert.\\nBlumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes the\\nnetwork. He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected to\\nErik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connected\\nto Tony Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson, and so forth, and in the course of\\ntracing these connections, he informs us, or reminds us, of the crimes and misdemeanors these people have\\ncommitted.\\nTwo of my favorites are James Dobson\\'s son Ryan\\'s messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--did\\nhe not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter\\'s habitual recourse to a brothel in\\nNew Orleans where Republicans \"wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--Republicans have\\nimpeccable taste in silk stockings\" (the madam is talking about men). Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes--\\nboth those we\\'ve already heard of, such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard\\'s, and those we haven\\'t (there is good\\nevidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder of the right wing Council For National Policy, ordered\\nhits on his estranged wife, and succeeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife\\'s boyfriend).\\nThis aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A\\nJustified Sinner by James Hogg, in which, once a man believes he is among the saved, he can commit any sin he\\nwants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was \"saved,\" for example, he said, \"My goal is to get to\\nheaven. I\\'ll do anything it takes to get there, and I\\'m not going to let anything stand in my way.\" He must have\\nthought getting to heaven was just another power play.\\nAnd power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing that\\nBlumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully, a man like Jack Abramoff,\\nwhose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates, but who sang like a bird once he was caught.\\nAt the center of is James Dobson, a much more destructive figure than Abramoff, who advocates, in the\\nstrongest terms, child beating, and not only child-beating, but dog-beating. At one point he brags about going\\nafter the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in \"the most vicious fight ever staged\\nbetween man and beast.\" As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until \"he wants(s) to crumple on\\nthe breast of his parent.\" In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,\\nover the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.\\nIt order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthal\\ncites Erich Fromm\\'s Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Eric\\nHoffer\\'s The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of these\\npowerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It\\'s a high number.\\nThe beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessons\\nabout God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that he\\nsurpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shame\\nand guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in the\\nhierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy.\\nBlumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I\\'m sure he was reared by\\nliberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in his\\nthirties, I don\\'t think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been\\ninterviewing and watching for the last few years. I don\\'t think he understands their fear--how deep it is, how\\nconstant it is, and how arousing it is. I don\\'t think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. I\\nthink he looks within, and says, \"I\\'m okay; you\\'re okay.\" That\\'s the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tell\\nby statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and occurrence of STDs, liberal parenting works--\\natheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that have\\nsex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy.\\nBut a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes no\\nsense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to try\\nto figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conforming\\nto a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group can\\nbe anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them,\\ntoo, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child\\'s sense of terror\\ncan only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he is\\ndefined as powerless. When he \"crumples\" on the \"loving\" breast of his parent (and in my view a person who\\nadministers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn\\'t know what love is) he accepts his\\npowerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life.\\nThat\\'s where your freedom and mine come in.\\nMany of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Taliban\\nonly in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to never\\nshare power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeply\\nhierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban.\\nIt\\'s an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide\\nof 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love,\\nand understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. In\\nhis book, The Institutes of Biblical Law, he advocates capital punishment for \"disobedient children, unchaste\\nwomen, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners of witchcraft, adulterers,\" and homosexuals. Gary North, the\\nPresbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, is his son-in-law, and, while not backing down on the mass death\\npenalty, advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake, because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is a\\nfactor, because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of you\\nand me, if they could catch us), well, Christians would, but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to accept\\nresponsibility, they assign agency to God, who wants us killed, who will beat us until we \"crumple\" on his\\n\"loving\" breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these Christian\\nDominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is \"Adore me or I will hurt you.\"\\nCan you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too,\\nthought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physical\\npunishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about\\neffective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-\\nbetween man and beast.\" As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until \"he wants(s) to crumple on\\nthe breast of his parent.\" In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,\\nover the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.\\nIt order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthal\\ncites Erich Fromm\\'s Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Eric\\nHoffer\\'s The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of these\\npowerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It\\'s a high number.\\nThe beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessons\\nabout God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that he\\nsurpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shame\\nand guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself. He will then take his place in the\\nhierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy.\\nBlumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I\\'m sure he was reared by\\nliberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in his\\nthirties, I don\\'t think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been\\ninterviewing and watching for the last few years. I don\\'t think he understands their fear--how deep it is, how\\nconstant it is, and how arousing it is. I don\\'t think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. I\\nthink he looks within, and says, \"I\\'m okay; you\\'re okay.\" That\\'s the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tell\\nby statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and occurrence of STDs, liberal parenting works--\\natheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that have\\nsex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy.\\nBut a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes no\\nsense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to try\\nto figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conforming\\nto a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group can\\nbe anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them,\\ntoo, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child\\'s sense of terror\\ncan only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he is\\ndefined as powerless. When he \"crumples\" on the \"loving\" breast of his parent (and in my view a person who\\nadministers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn\\'t know what love is) he accepts his\\npowerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life.\\nThat\\'s where your freedom and mine come in.\\nMany of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Taliban\\nonly in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to never\\nshare power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeply\\nhierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban.\\nIt\\'s an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide\\n:. of 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love,\\nand understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus.

I soon realized that my motives for administering physical\\npunishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about\\neffective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-\\nbeating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter, and had much more family disruption, than the\\nparents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works with\\nhorses, dogs, and other animals, too. It was then I decided that if I, in my human weakness, could put two and\\ntwo together concerning free will and proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn\\'t want to believe in a God\\nwho was a smaller being than myself. And I don\\'t.\\nThe ray of hope in Blumenthal\\'s book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologically\\nunstable that they don\\'t have much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But they have numbers. The bad thing\\nabout that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R-\\nVA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), and Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us \"back from the\\nbrink\" according to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that they\\nwould not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing is\\nthat they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view, well, I think,\\nStalinism lasted about 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia and\\nGermany survived, Iran might, as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and Hitler\\ndidn\\'t have nuclear weapons.\\nI think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store, looking down the barrel of that pistol. He probably\\nhad no idea that his killer had no sense of agency, hardly even knew what he was doing, was seeing his hand as\\nseparate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer, too, subject to feelings that he could not label that\\nwere terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten, shamed, and neglected as a child. I bet, afterward, he\\nwished someone, somehow, had stopped him.\\nDon\\'t forget to buy one: Max Blumenthal, Republican Gomorrah, Nationbooks, available at your local\\nbookstore and anywhere else that\\nbooks are sold.\\nRead more at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah b 290293.htmlUpdate 2009-10-02.docx\\nOscar, can u pls print for hrc tonite\\nThx.Am about to fax %roll the latest draft.

I\\'ve thought about it some more and,\\nwhile I have no silver bullet, here are some further thoughts.\\n-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target some\\nAQ in Pakistan and that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and more\\nabout with whom AQ is imbedded..\\n-- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they want\\nto cultivate in the event we \"leave\" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen that\\nbefore and will hedge their bets.\\n-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we can\\ndisabuse them of the perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanis\\nto go after AQ in sanctuaries provided by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistan\\ndominated by the Taliban.\\n-- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted against\\nmilitary leaders who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, we\\ncan go after bank accounts, travel and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raising\\nthe stakes for those supporting the militants without creating an inordinate backlash . Blunter\\nmeasures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be counterproductive. Given\\nthe level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp swing of\\nthe U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult for\\nthe Pakistani people to accept.\\n-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Of\\ncourse, the military\\'s calculation is most important. I\\'m not sure what is on their shopping list these\\ndays but we would need to balance what would move the needle on AQ against undercutting our\\neffort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India. . At the same time, we can be as\\nforward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment, training,\\nwhatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into Wazeristan --\\nincluding relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible to\\ndemonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..\\n-- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used can\\nbe played to our strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the use\\nof these funds -- without greatly undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to press\\nthem on AQ.\\n-- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could take\\nthat would reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus on\\nthreats to the East, including both AQ and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidence\\nbuilding measures such as information sharing on troop movements that would both reduce\\nuncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from India to the militancy?\\nTo the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants, they could\\nsee such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.\\nSandyIndonesians cannot do 9. Asking for 10am instead. Philippines will likely be right after.\\nHope that\\'s ok.Eikenberry has asked if u can talk at 9am?\\nThen philippines 9:45 and indonesia immediately after.\\nOk?FYII\\'m at the office reviewing the first draft of the paper so will call in a bit.On secureI have to let PJ respond, because I honestly don\\'t know what was executedPi, correct me if I\\'m wrong but I think the letter text was finalized, but not yet produced/delivered.

I also appreciate your offer to meet with me the next time we\\nare both in Washington and would like to take you up on it.\\nI am now working with a serious American engineering and construction company, Symbion Power, that has\\nbeen hugely successful in Iraq and Afghanistan (on fixed cost contracts). It specializes in power plants,\\nsubstations and transmission towers and lines. It made its name in Iraq constructing transmission towers and\\npulling lines across al Anbar province at the height of the war there. Its business model is to partner with local\\ncompanies and to train local employees to do the construction, maintenance and repair, and to provide the\\nsecurity. In Iraq and Afghanistan they established training centers and graduated over 3000 certified\\nlinemen. They partner with an American Lineman College in Idaho to provide the ed ucation and\\ncertification. We think the model is well adapted to Africa and have already begun work on a training center in\\nTanzania, where we will be bidding on all of the upcoming MCC financed power generation and distribution\\nprojects. I have asked Sid to pass a memory stick with a four minute video that explains what Symbion does\\nand how it does it.\\nI tell you all this, not to tout Symbion (about which I am very enthusiastic) but let you know that we are doing\\nmuch of what you have been advocating in your public comments about human capacity development. The fact\\nthat we have been successful on fixed cost contracts also speaks to your criticism of American companies that\\nhave been milking the government with their cost plus contracts for the last nine years. Our goal is to\\ndemonstrate that an emphasis on developing local talent is not just the right thing to do but is also good\\nbusiness.\\nI look forward to seeing you the next time I am in Washington. I know how precious your time is, and very\\nmuch appreciate your generosity.\\nWith warm regards and best wishes.\\nJoeShe has been confirmed for 10am.MoreFYIThanks, Also, Sergei Kislyak told me last evening that the change in administrations here + the missile defense decision\\nmade it much easier for Russia to be helpful on Iran last week. Re connecting, I\\'m off this evening to Rhodes, Athens,\\nParis, Oslo, & Istanbul, but I can be reached via my office as I bounce around.

Todd said he would send you a read out.Hillary: FYI: I found this one of the most sensible and informed brief articles on Afghanistan. Patrick Cockburn, of\\nthe London Independent, is one of the best informed on-the-ground journalists. He was almost always correct on\\nIraq. Sid\\nPatrick Cockburn: To say this war must be won\\nin a year is nonsense\\nhttp://www.independent co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockbum-to-say-this-war-must-be-won-\\nin-a-year-is-nonsense-1799296.html\\nThursday, 8 October 2009\\nSPONSORED LINKS:\\nEight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky\\nas the US air strikes started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of fire\\nfrom Taliban anti-aircraft guns which could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down\\non them.\\nIt was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of the\\nAfghan fighting man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In the\\nmeantime they don\\'t fight too hard for anybody and try to avoid getting killed.\\nThe US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missed\\nthe point that the Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of a\\nTaliban armoured brigade in the city of Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicles\\nhad all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but when I asked local people how many men\\nthe Taliban had lost, I was told \"none at all. They could see what was going to happen so they just\\nran away.\"\\nJust as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of military\\ncrisis which is being busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander\\nin Afghanistan. In Washington military officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in\\nthe next twelve months.\\nThis is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because\\nthey have Pakistani backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of\\nPresident Hamid Karzai\\'s government. But the Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun\\ncommunity, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population. They will have great difficulty\\nadvancing into areas occupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a Tajik,\\nHazara or Uzbek majority.\\nSquads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but there\\nis no need to treat them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975.\\nThe strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflict\\nquite small military losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home. They can do this\\nthrough roadside bombs, something the US army speaks as i f it were a new device, though it was\\nbeing used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the Americans and British try to hold territory\\nsupposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are vulnerable to being\\nsuddenly targeted by the other side.\\nIt is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. But\\nAfghans tell me that more foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more\\nof the country becomes a battlefield. It is absurd to imagine that the world\\'s most heavily equipped\\nmilitary force is not going to use its weapons when it comes under attack. Polls also show that\\nTaliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been killed by\\nAmerican shells and bombs.\\nSo what should Obama do? First of all he has time. He is not going to win or lose the war in the next\\nyear. Like it or not he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable to\\nsuggest helping to produce a larger Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight.\\nMost military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear American flack\\njackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men,\\noften on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weeks\\ntraining. Many of them did not come back.\\nOne way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid\\nproperly. In Kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not\\nenough to live on unless supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to\\nforeign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properly\\nreally did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in Afghanistan where 40 per cent of\\nmen are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion while the\\nAfghan government is dependent on foreign aid.\\nThe US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should\\nbe considering and not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops.Abedin, Huma <AbedinH@state.gov>\\nSaturday, August 22, 2009 12:01 PM\\nH\\nFw: (Reuters) Germany\\'s Steinmeier proposes Afghan pull-out talksWill check\\nI know melanne moved forward after she discussed with you.

Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to\\nestablish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the\\nCommission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known\\nas the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace\\nacademy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP\\'s Board\\nof Directors took place in 1986.\\nThe USIP Act established \"an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government\\nthrough the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace\\ninformation services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and\\npeoples of the world without recourse to violence.\"\\nUSIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy\\nresearch, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country-\\nspecific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include:\\n® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate\\ndialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and\\neducating the public through events, films, and other outreach.\\nO USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries.\\n® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria,\\nKorea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti.\\n® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional\\nCommission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry.\\nMichael H.

We\\'re getting it around to friends & family, along with\\nPeople op-ed and NYT Mag q&a - was a great weekend in terms of positive press.\\nIt\\'s 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is?\\nBy David Rothkopf\\nWashington Post\\nSunday, August 23, 2009\\nWhen it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton, we\\'re missing the forest for the pantsuits.\\nClinton is not the first celebrity to become the nation\\'s top diplomat -- that honor goes to her most distant predecessor,\\nThomas Jefferson, who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped-about men in America --\\nbut she may be the biggest. And during her first seven months in office, the former first lady, erstwhile presidential\\ncandidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods, looks, outtakes and (of course)\\nrelationship with her husband than for, well, her work revamping the nation\\'s foreign policy.\\nEven venerable publications -- such as one to which I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- have woven into their all-\\nHillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions of Clinton\\'s handbag and scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, while\\ndepicting herself as a Clinton supporter, has been scathing and small-minded in discussing such things as Clinton\\'s\\nweight and hair, while her \"defense\" of Hillary in her essay \"Obama\\'s Other Wife\" was as sexist as the title suggests.\\nIndeed, sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom, as seen most recently in the posturing\\noutrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now-infamous\\nquestion regarding her husband\\'s views. Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest, whether the New York Times,\\nwhich covered Clinton\\'s first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White House, or The\\nWashington Post, where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer of\\nchoice for the secretary of state.\\nAmid all the distractions, what is Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes in\\nU.S. foreign policy in two decades -- a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W.\\nBush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post-Cold War worldview.\\nThe secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision into a revitalized\\nState Department, one that approaches U.S. allies and rivals in ways that challenge long-held traditions. And despite the\\npessimists who invoked the \"team of rivals\" cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get along,\\nHillary has defined a role for herself in the Obamaverse: often bad cop to his good cop, spine stiffener when it comes to\\ntough adversaries and nurturer of new strategies. Recognizing that the 3 a.m. phone calls are going to the White House,\\nshe is instead tackling the tough questions that, since the end of the Cold War, have kept America\\'s leaders awake all\\nnight.\\nIn these early days of the new administration, it has been easy to focus on what Clinton has not achieved or on ways in\\nwhich her power has been supposedly constrained. Indeed, some of her efforts have been frustrated by difficult\\npersonnel approvals or disputes with the White House about who should get what jobs. But this is the way of all\\nadministrations. More unusual has been the avidity with which the new president has seized the reins of foreign policy --\\nmore assertively than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton before him. Obama\\'s centrality amplifies the importance of\\nhis closest White House staffers, while his penchant for appointing special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke (on\\nAfghanistan and Pakistan) and George Mitchell (on the Middle East) has been interpreted by some as limiting Clinton\\'s\\nrole.\\nGiven the challenges involved, it was perhaps natural that the White House would have a bigger day-to-day hand in\\nsome of the nation\\'s most urgent foreign policy issues. But with Obama, national security adviser Jim Jones, Vice\\nPresident Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates absorbed by Iraq, Afghanistan and other inherited problems\\nof the recent past, Clinton\\'s State Department can take on a bigger role in tackling the problems of the future -- in\\nparticular, how America will lead the world in the century ahead. This approach is both necessary and canny: It\\nrecognizes that U.S. policy must change to fulfill Obama\\'s vision and that many high-profile issues such as those of the\\nMiddle East have often swamped the careers and aspirations of secretaries of state past.\\nWhich nations will be our key partners? What do you do when many vital partners -- China, for example, and Russia --\\nare rivals as well? How must America\\'s alliances change as NATO is stretched to the limit? How do we engage with rogue\\nstates and old enemies in ways that do not strengthen them and preserve our prerogative to challenge threats? How do\\nwe move beyond the diplomacy of men in striped pants speaking only for governments and embrace potent nonstate\\nplayers and once-disenfranchised peoples?\\nIn searching for answers, Clinton is leaving behind old doctrines and labels. She outlined her new thinking in a recent\\nspeech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where she revealed stark differences between the new\\nadministration\\'s worldview and those of its predecessors: The recurring themes include \"partnership\" and\\n\"engagement\" and \"common interests.\" Clearly, Madeleine Albright\\'s \"indispensable nation\" has recognized the\\nindispensability of collaborating with others.\\nWho those \"others\" are is the area in which change has been greatest and most rapid. \"We will put,\" Clinton said,\\n\"special emphasis on encouraging major and emerging global powers -- China, India, Russia and Brazil, as well as Turkey,\\nIndonesia and South Africa -- to be full partners in tackling the global agenda.\" This is the death knell for the G-8 as the\\nhead table of the global community; the administration has an effort underway to determine whether the successor to\\nthe G-8 will be the G-20, or perhaps some other grouping. Though the move away from the G-8 began in the waning\\ndays of the Bush era, that administration viewed the world through a different lens, a perception that evolved from a\\ntraditional great-power view to a pre-Galilean notion that everything revolved around the world\\'s sole superpower.\\nObama and Clinton have both made engaging with emerging powers a priority. Obama visited Russia earlier this year\\nand will host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his first state dinner in November. Clinton has made trips to\\nChina and India, and she would have been with Obama in Russia had she not injured her elbow. Both have visited Africa\\nand the Middle East, reaching out to women and the Islamic world.\\nOn many critical agenda items -- from a rollback of nuclear weapons to the climate or trade talks -- such emerging\\npowers will be essential to achieving U.S. goals. As a result, we\\'ve seen a new American willingness to play down old\\ndifferences, whether with Russia on a missile shield or, as Clinton showed on her China trip, with Beijing on human\\nrights.\\nAt the center of Clinton\\'s brain trust is Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former dean of Princeton\\'s Woodrow Wilson School of\\nPublic and International Affairs. Now head of policy planning at the State Department, Slaughter elaborated on the ideas\\nin Clinton\\'s speech. \"We envision getting not just a new group of states around a table, but also building networks,\\ncoalitions and partnerships of states and nonstate actors to tackle specific problems,\" she told me.\\n\"To do that,\" Slaughter continued, \"our diplomats are going to need to have skills that are closer to community\\norganizing than traditional reporting and analysis. New connecting technologies will be vital tools in this kind of\\ndiplomacy.\"\\nA new team has been brought in to make these changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross, one of the leaders of Obama\\'s\\ntechnology policy team, to the seventh floor of the State Department as her senior adviser for innovation. His mission is\\nto harness new information tools to advance U.S. interests -- a task made easier as the Internet and mobile networks\\nhave played starring roles in recent incidents, from Iran to the Uighur uprising in western China to Moldova. Whether\\nthrough a telecommunications program in Congo to protect women from violence or text messaging to raise money for\\nPakistani refugees in the Swat Valley, technology has been deployed to reach new audiences.\\nOf course, you need more than new ideas to revitalize the State Department; you need resources, too. The secretary has\\nbrought in former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew to help her claw back money for statecraft that many in Foggy\\nBottom feel has been sucked off toward the Pentagon. She has also created special positions to back new priorities, such\\nas Melanne Verveer as ambassador at large for women\\'s issues, Elizabeth Bagley to handle public-private outreach\\nworldwide and Todd Stern as the chief negotiator on climate.\\nEven just a few months in, it\\'s clear that these appointments are far from window dressing. Lew, Slaughter and the\\nacting head of the U.S. Agency for International Development are leading an effort to rethink foreign aid with the new\\nQuadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, an initiative modeled on the Pentagon\\'s strategic assessments and\\ndesigned to review State\\'s priorities. Stern has conducted high-level discussions on climate change around the world,\\nnotably with China. Clinton made women\\'s issues a centerpiece of her recent 11-day trip to Africa, where she stressed\\nthat \"the social, political and economic marginalization of women across Africa has left a void in this continent that\\nundermines progress and prosperity.\"\\nClinton has also signaled the importance of private-sector experience by naming former Goldman Sachs International\\nvice chairman Robert Hormats, a respected veteran of four administrations, to handle economic issues at the State\\nDepartment, as well as Judith McHale, former chief executive of Discovery Communications, to run public diplomacy. In\\nthe same vein, she has opened up Cuba to American telecommunications companies and reached out to India\\'s private\\nsector on energy cooperation -- showing that this administration will seek to advance national interests by tapping the\\nself-interests of the business community. As with any new administration, there have been inevitable problems. The old\\ncampaign teams -- Clinton\\'s and Obama\\'s -- still eye each other warily, but this feeling is gradually fading. And by most\\naccounts, the administration\\'s national security team has come together successfully, with Clinton developing strong\\nrelationships with national security adviser Jones and Defense Secretary Gates. Her policy deputy, Jim Steinberg, has\\nrenewed an old collaboration with deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; the two of them, working with Obama\\ncampaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert, have formed what one State Department\\nseventh-floor dweller called \"a powerful quartet at the heart of real interagency policymaking.\" Henry Kissinger may\\nhave overstated matters when he said this is the best White House-State relationship in recent memory, but it\\'s not bad,\\nwhile the State-Pentagon relationship is in its best shape in decades.\\nAt the heart of things, though, is the relationship between Clinton and Obama. For all the administration\\'s talk of\\ninternational partnerships, that may be the most critical partnership of all.\\nSo far, according to multiple high-level officials at State and the White House, the two seem aligned in their views. In\\naddition, they are gradually defining complementary roles. Obama has assumed the role of principal spokesperson on\\nforeign policy, as international audiences welcome his new and improved American brand. Clinton thus far has echoed\\nhis points but has also delivered tougher ones. Whether on a missile shield against Iran or North Korean saber-rattling,\\nthe continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma or rape and corruption in Congo, the secretary of state has\\nspoken bluntly on the world stage -- even if it triggered snide comments from North Korea.\\nIt is still early, and a president\\'s foreign policy legacy is often defined less by big principles than by how one reacts to the\\nunexpected, whether missiles in Cuba or terrorism in New York. Promising ideas fail because of limited attention or\\nreluctant bureaucracies, and some rhetoric eventually rings hollow, as the self-congratulatory \"smart power\" already\\ndoes to me.\\nNevertheless, there is evidence that, seven months into the job, Obama\\'s unlikely secretary of state is supporting and\\naugmenting his agenda effectively. Not as Obama\\'s \"other wife,\" not as Bill Clinton\\'s wife, not even as a celebrity or as a\\nformer presidential candidate -- but in a new role of her own making.\\nDavid Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of \"Superclass:\\nThe Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making\" and \"Running the World: The Inside Story of the NSC and the\\nArchitects of American Power.\" He will be online to chat with readers Monday at 11 a.m. Submit your questions and\\ncomments before or during the discussion.TO HOLD RUN-OFFVerveer, Melanne S <VerveerMS@state.gov>\\nFriday, September 04, 2009 2:55 PM\\nH\\nSwanee\\nWe were judging the candidates for the Swanee Hunt Award which goes annually to a FS0 and a FSN judged superior\\nfor integrating women\\'s issues into their work.

And below that the article on DeMint. S\\nWilliam Hague addresses US fears over Tories\\'\\nEU allies\\n•Hillary Clinton \\'told antisemitism allegations are a smear\\'\\n•Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader\\n• Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt\\n• quardian.co.uk, Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BST\\nWilliam Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday defended the Conservatives\\' alliance with far-right parties in\\nEurope during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.\\nHague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives\\' partners, some of whose members have taken part in\\ncommemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom in\\nPoland.\\nThe shadow foreign secretary, who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton, told her the accusations were part of a\\nsmear campaign by the Guardian and others.\\nThe row has overshadowed Hague\\'s visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for taking\\npower.\\nSpeaking to the media afterwards, Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski, of Poland\\'s Law and Justice party, was\\nnot consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives\\' European alliance, Hague\\nsaid: \"This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous.\"\\nJewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links.\\nThe state department was careful not be drawn into the issue, not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics or\\nissues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: \"I can say that the two had a good, wide-ranging\\ndiscussion on a broad range of issues, but can\\'t get into details or substance of that discussion.\"\\nHague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives\\' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play a\\nlesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.\\nHague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran, the\\nBalkans, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and climate change.\\n\"No one has raised with me all day the other issue, of the parties in our grouping, but I raised that with secretary of state\\nClinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those,\" Hague said.\\n\"I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as a\\nsmear campaign against some of its members.\"\\nHe noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism in\\nEurope and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. \"These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic,\"\\nHague said.\\nAs for the Latvians, of the six governing parties, \"five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration that\\nhave been criticised.\" Some were members of the Conservatives\\' previous alliance, the European People\\'s party.\\nOn Conservative Euroscepticism, Hague said: \"I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important to\\ndistinguish between Europe\\'s institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be find\\na Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. \"\\nLater he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blair\\nwould be appointed \"over my dead body\".\\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-10/irm-contras-scary-sequel\\nIran-Contra\\'s Scary Sequel\\nby Art Levine\\nThe Daily Beast\\nOctober 10, 2009 I 6:55pm\\nRepublicans have opened a new front against Obama, a southern front, south of the border—Latin America.\\nThe clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in the\\nGeorge W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of South\\nCarolina.\\nA freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America, DeMint\\nis best known for boasting that health care would be the \"Waterloo\" that will \"break\" Obama. He recently\\nprovoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to \"assess\" the crisis.\\nThe Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who\\nwas expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his \"intransigence\"\\nin putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America, and initially denied\\nmoney for DeMint\\'s trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through the\\nDefense Department.\\n\"DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order to\\ndefend a coup,\" says Adam Isacson, a Latin American specialist at Washington\\'s Center for International\\nPolicy.\\n\"Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet, and paralyzed policy by\\nprovoking the [DeMint] holds,\" Julia Sweig, the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on Foreign\\nRelations, told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: \"These losers from the Bush administration who drove\\nLatin American policy off a frickin\\' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy,\" one aide told The Daily Beast.\\nA number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin American\\npolicy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stance\\nagainst the president installed by the Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire to\\nappease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration \"slow-walked\" its\\nresponse to the coup this summer, Sweig says.\\nMore recently, though, the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least\\n$35 million and blocking Honduran officials\\' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter into\\nserious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.\\nInformed observers say that indications of Micheletti\\'s flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washington\\nand helped trigger DeMint\\'s visit to buck up the regime\\'s resistance.\\nAn informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelaya\\nlegal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich, a Cuban-American who headed the\\nState Department\\'s now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal, and was\\nsubsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel—and the U.S. Comptroller General, which\\nfound he engaged in \"prohibited covert activities\" by using public funds to attack Reagan\\'s critics. Reich, who\\nwas later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs and\\nis now a private consultant, launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption.\\n\"Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I\\'m an architect of the Zelaya\\ncoup,\" he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as \"crap,\"\\nasserting they were only based on a fired House staffer\\'s unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, a Latin\\nAmerican history professor at NYU, has a darker view of Reich\\'s role: \"It\\'s kind of the origins of Swift\\nBoating,\" he says. \"It\\'s all related to what he\\'s doing now.\"\\nConservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against the\\nworldwide condemnation of the coup. \"It\\'s not the first time all, the countries in the world have been wrong,\"\\nReich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies, taking\\nThe New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby on\\nbehalf of the Micheletti regime. \"I guess my facts interfered with [the] story,\" he says. \"Can you believe some\\nof my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?\" A\\nDeMint spokesman says the senator hasn\\'t even met with Reich to talk about Honduras, although a Reich aide\\nsays they\\'ve spoken to DeMint\\'s staff.\\nAdding to the mystery of the coup, left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservatives\\nsay are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya\\'s regime. He\\nhas firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: \"I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy charges\\nagainst me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya.\" But the rumors may add to his aura\\nof power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. He\\'s drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations by\\npenning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined, \"I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras.\"\\nPerhaps the primary influence on DeMint\\'s thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyer\\nMiguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by the\\nSenate. In addition to Reich, other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles in\\ninfluencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, a former aide\\nto the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as an\\nassistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared on The\\nNewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a former\\nambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute—\\nnot as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.\\nNoriega officially registered his firm, Visions America, as representing a Honduran business group only in mid-\\nJuly. Yet, the Times reported, he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetings\\nbetween supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early July. That visit to\\nWashington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10, Foreign Policy reported,\\noccurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich—along with a former Honduran\\nsupreme court justice and Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist—testified\\nin favor of the current regime. Noriega\\'s office declined to return phone calls about his work.\\nThe lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obama\\'s\\npicks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere\\nAffairs, has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela, director of Georgetown\\nUniversity\\'s Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the National\\nSecurity Council during President Clinton\\'s second term, has been tapped to be assistant secretary for Western\\nHemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\\nin late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes, \"They\\'re not polarizing figures.\"\\nBut for now they\\'re hostages in DeMint\\'s war. At the July 8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMint\\nby defending the administration\\'s decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: \"In my studies of military\\ncoups in Latin America, this was a classic military coup,\" Valenzuela said. DeMint\\'s critics contend that he has\\ncontinually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holds,\\nincluding the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees.\\nDeMint\\'s spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he\\'s acting in good faith out of genuine concern about an\\nimportant crisis. \"If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats, then why hasn\\'t Senator Reid brought\\nthem to the floor?\" he asks. \"There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote on\\nthem.\" Technically that\\'s true, but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has taken\\nup the issue of Honduras, Denton claims, because, \"the State Department\\'s actions were directly relevant to two\\nnominees seeking the committee\\'s approval.\"\\nYet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras—in what critics say is yet another vehicle to \"break\"\\nObama—one congressional observer jokes, \"He couldn\\'t find Honduras on a map.\"\\nArt Levine, a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly, has written for Mother Jones, The American\\nProspect, The New Republic, The Atlantic, Slate.com, Salon. corn, and numerous other publications.

STATE 86734\\nB. STATE 82581\\n1.(SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 - 6.\\n2.(SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government\\nprovisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a\\nbilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel).\\nWe expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota in\\nabout a month, following a final review by both sides. As\\nnoted in reftels, the DCA would permit the United States\\naccess to several Colombian military bases and facilitate\\neffective bilateral cooperation on security matters in\\nColombia. It would not/not authorize establishment of any\\nU.S. bases or ports, nor would it result in an overall\\nincrease in the number of U.S. military personnel or\\nU.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.\\n3.(SBU) On August 18, the Secretary and Colombian FM\\nJaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA,\\nincluding the importance of coordinating our public\\naffairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow).\\nThere is some concern that the upcoming Union of South\\nAmerican Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regional\\nreferendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe\\nwill attend the summit provided that a full range of\\nregional security matters can be discussed, not just the\\nDCA. In this context, we are reaching out to selected\\nUNASUR members to ask that they raise other regional\\nsecurity issues beyond the DCA.\\n4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and\\nLima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28\\nsummit to raise the importance of discussing the full\\nrange of regional security topics during the summit, and\\nnot merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host\\ngovernment.\\n265\\n5. (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors to\\nUNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from the\\nSecretary to host governments in advance of the August 28\\nsummit.\\n6. (U) Begin text:\\nDear Madam/Mr. Minister:\\nI wanted to take a moment to write to you and your\\ncolleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South\\nAmerican Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in\\nBariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address\\nthe issues and challenges that affect the region. The\\nUnited States supports the formation and effective\\nfunctioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They\\npromote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,\\nand ensure the best possible communication between\\nnations.\\nAs you know, our common neighbor,\\nColombia, has faced an ongoing threat from an unholy\\nalliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidious\\nillegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatened\\nthe security of average Colombians and sought to overthrow\\nby violence and corruption successive,\\ndemocratically-elected Colombian governments. The actions\\nof these groups also threaten the security of other\\ncountries in the hemisphere, sometimes directly, in many\\nways indirectly. Over the last decade, Colombians have\\nbeat back this threat, to the benefit of us all. My\\ncountry is proud of the role we have been able to play in\\nthis effort.\\nThis battle is far from won. Our governments and people\\nare collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselves\\nand our institutions from such threats. I am certain\\nthese very issues will be addressed at the upcoming\\nsummit, including the recently concluded Defense\\nCooperation Agreement (DCA). We understand the\\nsensitivities associated with U.S. military activities in\\nthe hemisphere and the questions your government may have\\nregarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hope\\nthe efforts made in the last few weeks by both my\\ngovernment and the Colombian government have helped\\naddress those questions.\\nI would like to take this opportunity to make several key\\npoints about the DCA. First, this agreement is a\\nbilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen our\\ncooperation on security challenges within Colombia,\\npermitting U.S. access to specified agreed Colombian\\n26fi\\nfacilities to undertake mutually agreed activities on\\nColombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement that\\ndoes not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of other\\nnations. On the contrary, our mutual efforts to combat\\ndrug trafficking benefit the security of the region as a\\nwhole. The agreement does not permit the establishment of\\nU.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increase\\nin the U.S. military presence in Colombia, and we do not\\nseek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or from\\nColombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated in\\nadvance by Colombian authorities. All activities will be\\nbased on full respect for the principles of sovereignty,\\nterritorial integrity of states, and\\nnon-interventionism.\\nWe are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in\\naddressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with\\nnations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in\\nrecent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns\\nor questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to\\nreach out to us to seek clarification.\\nThe UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the\\norganization to address a range of security issues that\\naffect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for\\ndeciding to discuss these matters. The security\\nchallenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in\\nparticular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is\\nthat a collective and collaborative approach to these\\nmatters is essential. It is our commitment to work with\\nUNASUR nations to help address these concerns.\\nSincerely yours,\\nHillary Rodham Clinton\\nEnd text.Will do.\\nMccain also called wjc office today asking to come to cgi.OkSecure fax coming in 5 min.\\nOAAlso, steinmeir asking to talk to u about afghanistan either today between 3:30 and 4.

We\\'re sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here\\'s\\nmy piece....\\nThanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.\\nPresident Barack Obama\\'s announcement of a new system.for protecting America\\'s\\nallies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he\\ninherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.\\nIn fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to\\ncounter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties.\\nMr Bush\\'s decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in\\nthe Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets\\nthat could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-\\nrange Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America\\'s\\nally Turkey, unprotected.\\nOver the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few\\nlong-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an\\nimmediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forces\\nstationed there. Unlike Mr Bush\\'s, Mr Obama\\'s plan will quickly field a missile-defence\\ncapability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range\\nIranian missiles in the future.\\nThe Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm\\nshould recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible\\none strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.\\nThe view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there\\nsuspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used\\noffensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenario\\nwas not the prime motivation for Mr Obama\\'s decision, nor should it have been. However,\\nby removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has\\nimproved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway in\\nGeneva.\\nThose talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -\\nthat is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy,\\ngiven the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on track\\nfor further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,\\nwho are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of\\neliminating nuclear weapons.\\nAs they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a\\nstark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being\\nvulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump the\\nother side\\'s offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be\\non hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis.\\nAmerican statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially\\nsceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)\\ntreaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensive\\ncapability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a\\nseries of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were\\nexpected to with us forever, the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.\\nWhile the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan\\nwas not. The late US president championed the development of a space-based\\ncomprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and therefore mutual\\ndeterrence — \"impotent and obsolete.\"\\nMany experts believed Reagan\\'s vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was\\nan impossible dream. So did his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program\\nwith benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms Reduction\\nTalks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.\\nThe second president Bush reversed his father\\'s policy. He greatly weakened the\\nSTART process, pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national\\nmissile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites in\\nPoland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large\\nmeasure about \"pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.\"\\nKey officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself, who studied\\narms control in college — understand the linkage between reduction of offences and\\nregulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising that issue in the context of last\\nweek\\'s decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own\\nmerits, vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights\\nwith the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the\\nprinciples of the ABM treaty.\\nYet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating\\nstrategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be\\neither impossible or, worse, dangerous.\\nThe author is president of the Brookings Institution.I understand cherly forwarded you the unga demarche points Do you have edits to them?taking jan off\\nwe have been talking to wjc team about a dinner friday night post cgi (that i believe you and wjc discussed) and if we do\\nthat, we can include her there.\\nyou should know that barbra striesand and jim brolin have also askedif you and wjc want to have dinner friday night if\\nyou are interested. her performance is sat nightdoes it make sense to do it every monday so you have your series of meetings the top of the week and then people can\\nget direction for the week?OkDon\\'t think oscar was able to get this to you before you left. Its a few ny notes from chris falvo before the school event:\\nTO: Secretary Clinton\\nFROM: Chris Falvo\\nDATE: September 8, 2009\\nRE: NY Local Issues\\nSchools - NYC public schools open on Wednesday, September 9th. As a result, you will be visiting a charter school that\\nopened a couple of weeks ago instead of a public school. Mike Mulgrew, who took over as President of the UFT when\\nRandi left for AFT, will be present at the event and should be acknowledged in your remarks. His aides who you have\\nmet numerous times, Dick Riley and Bridget Rein, will also be present. Mike appointed Dick as his press secretary last\\nmonth.\\nH1N1 - Mayor Bloomberg did a rollout earlier this week on NYC\\'s plans to handle this health concern, and a significant\\nportion discusses schools. Unlike what was done in the Spring, this time closing schools will be a last resort. Reason is\\nthat they found kids still contaminate each other by going to movies and playgrounds when the schools are closed, so\\ninstead they are asking sick kids to stay home.\\nAnd if four percent of a student body experiences the flu on a single day, a doctor will visit to monitor the situation.\\nEvery student in a NYC school will be offered free H1N1 flu shots or mist once a vaccine is available.\\nPrimary day - September 15th is primary day. In addition to Bill Thompson for Mayor, the primary races that have been\\nclosely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric Gioia,\\nCouncilmember Bill DeBlasio, former Public Advocate Mark Green, and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running for\\nComptroller are four Councilmembers: John Lui, Melinda Katz, David Yassky, and David Weprin.\\nRangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways and\\nMeans Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House, Rangel failed\\nto disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into his\\nfailure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developer\\nwho leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel\\'s fundraising and\\nwhether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of New\\nYork. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post and\\nBuffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday, Rangel\\nsaid that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. \"Some Americans have not\\ngotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, \\'How did this happen?\\' \"\\nRangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.\\n\"Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can\\'t we get what God has given us? That is the right to live as\\nhuman beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing,\" he said. After\\nthe forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. \"What I\\'m saying is, if you watch the town-hall\\nmeetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry with\\ntheir member of Congress, period,\" he said. Rangel\\'s comments came less than two weeks after Governor Paterson\\nclaimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama\\'s plan is racially\\ndriven. The White House disagreed with Paterson\\'s comments.\\n120\\nLittle League World Series - Staten Island\\'s little league team, the South Shore Nationals, made it to the Little League\\nWorld Series, but they lost the title two weeks ago with a 4-1 loss to the Southwest Regional Champs, McAllister Park\\nAmerican, from San Antonio.\\n9/11 - Jay Winuk, founder of the My Good Deed organization, and brother of 9/11 victim, Glenn Winuk, notified us that\\nDOJ has finally award his brother the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor.

SidOkcheryl.mill _\\nSaturday, August 29, 2009 5:41 AM\\nH\\nFw: Other USAID names\\nSent via BlackBerry by AT&TKMagazine\\nThe Power Grid\\nBack From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House,\\nreturned from the brink.\\n•Published Oct 11, 2009\\nOn the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care\\nbill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the\\nlegislation instead. \"It\\'s just too weak,\" he told me. \"It doesn\\'t do enough It doesn\\'t achieve real cost savings. There\\'s no real\\ncompetition. It\\'s pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies.\" And those were merely Weiner\\'s substantive criticisms of the\\nbill. His political assessment was even harsher: \"It\\'s effectively dead,\" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner\\'s dismissal of the Baucus\\nplan came as any sort of shock; he\\'s been trashing the Senate Finance Committee\\'s efforts for weeks. What\\'s surprising is that anyone\\ngives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more\\nfor his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as\\nWeiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to\\nnonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean\\ninto the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest\\nand savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it\\'s plain that whatever bill\\neventually lands on Barack Obama\\'s desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care\\npaper will wind up there—won\\'t be anything close to Weiner\\'s single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has\\nbeen more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it\\'s been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have\\na long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé\\nand we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious,\\nwicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in\\nother words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a\\nmatter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. \"This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn\\'t have a mother ship\\nthat was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,\" he says. \"You didn\\'t have the president out there\\nspeaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren\\'t people that jumped out who either had a comfort\\nwith the material or weren\\'t intimidated by the blowback\" Weiner laughs. \"Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town-\\nhall meeting, someone on my staff said, \\'I can\\'t tell if you\\'re a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum\\nthat he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and\\ndeath of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of\\nwhat would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton\\'s absence and its implications carry a personal twist;\\nhe is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary\\'s longtime personal aide. \"It\\'s a weird irony that I\\'m kind of part of the family now and this\\nhas become my issue,\" Weiner says. \"If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening.\" Weiner allows that\\nhe\\'s discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she\\'s told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the\\ncleverness and chutzpa he\\'s displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an\\nequation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a\\n\"government takeover\" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary\\'s chagrin at watching the Obama White House\\npursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and\\n1994. Weiner\\'s view of the administration\\'s approach hasn\\'t exactly been approving—a point he\\'s made abundantly and consistently\\nclear over the past months. On the eve of Obama\\'s September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that \"up to\\nnow, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple\\nof hours.\" And he\\'s apparently had no change of heart. \"The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,\" he tells\\nme.\\nSuch criticisms haven\\'t gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his\\nconsistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn\\'t shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to\\nWashington from New York on Air Force One, I\\'m told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testyFYIMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nSaturday, August 29, 2009 6:20 AM\\nH\\nSullivan, Jacob J\\nFw: Honduras Military Coup Decision\\nSee WI - will call you later today to discuss my convs on this matterFyiFyiFYIFYIHe can to anytime this morning before 1pm, or anytime tomorrow.

III get info to both of uBarack Obama snubs Gordon Brown over private\\ntalks\\nWhite House spurned five requests from PM\\'s aides for bilateral meeting\\nGordon Brown and Barack Obama at a joint news conference at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in\\nLondon in April 2009. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reufers\\nGordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it\\nemerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to\\nhold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today.\\nThe prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week,\\nwas also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to\\nill health or deteriorating eyesight.\\nThere have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Brown\\'s handling of the Scottish\\ngovernment\\'s decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.\\nBrown\\'s efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New\\nYork were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN,\\nmassively running over Brown\\'s 15 minute slot.\\nBrown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint\\npress conference, an event that would have boosted Brown\\'s efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of\\ninternational diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu\\nimmunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations.\\nNo 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they\\nsat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future\\neconomic regulation, bankers\\' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: \"I\\ndo say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen.\"\\nBut Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian\\npresident, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama.\\nNews of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a\\nparliamentary aide resign over the prime minister\\'s refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she\\nwas fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary\\nCharles Clarke.\\nStephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: \"In my view, the facts of the\\ncase do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public\\'s trust of Whitehall is\\nuncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable.\"\\nBrown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown\\'s leadership\\nrisked letting \"the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general\\nelection] and sink for a very long time\". He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. \"I\\nthink his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution.\"\\nIn two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. \"My sight is not at all\\ndeteriorating,\" he told NBC.\\nAsked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: \"I am healthy\\nand I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit.\\n\"I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge.\"\\nIn his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush\\nadministration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will\\nfocus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: \"The time has come for the world to move in\\na new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\"\\nLast week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he\\ndisapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not\\nhighlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero\\'s\\nwelcome as he returned to Tripoli.\\nBrown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low-\\nkey had been broken.\\nIn an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel\\nGaddafi after Libya\\'s leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council\\nshould be renamed \"the terror council\".\\nBrown countered in his speech in New York later: \"I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call\\non everyone to support its universal principles.\"\\nHe urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism\\nthat were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: \"If we miss this opportunity to protect our\\nplanet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global\\nagreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we\\nare inflicting on future generations.\"\\nHe added: \"If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are\\ngoing to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop\\ndeforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially.\"\\nNo 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were\\n\"without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having\\na number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night\\'s\\nclimate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the\\nfight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit\\nin Pittsburgh.\"FyiBarack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as \\'special\\nrelationship\\' sinks to new low\\nGordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama\\nduring his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of\\nthe Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left \"the special relationship\"\\nat its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.\\nBy Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York\\nPublished: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009\\nBritish officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy\\nchange in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.\\nBut the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing\\non his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York\\nkitchen.\\nThe setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point\\nsince John Major\\'s frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.\\nIt was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the\\nPresident hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that\\nthis was not unusual.\\nHowever, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House\\'s refusal to meet Mr Brown had\\nbeen a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.\\n\"It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone,\" the source said.\\n\"There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.\"\\nThe most striking example of Downing Street\\'s desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on\\nsupplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America\\'s commitment and was announced last week.\\nAs a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior\\nsource. However, the meeting never happened.\\nThe White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would\\n\"spend all day Friday together.\" However, Friday\\'s meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world\\nleaders.\\nThe release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the\\nnew chill in relations between Washington and London.\\nMr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.\\nDowning Street\\'s original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President\\'s anger.\\nMr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.\\nNearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families\\nof victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya\\'s leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made\\nspeeches.\\nLast night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal\\ndiscussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The\\n15-minute \"walk and chat\" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in\\nManhattan.\\nNo 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate \"bilateral\"\\nmeeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting\\nwith Mr Obama.\\nIn a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must \"move in a new direction\" and \"embrace20a\\nnew era of engagement\". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on\\nrelations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown\\'s increasingly poor\\nrelationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close\\nfriendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.\\nJohn Major\\'s Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had\\ntried to help George Bush Snr\\'s re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton\\'s\\nstudent past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.\\nMr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for\\n96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.\\nKathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to\\nNew York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of\\njustice for victims families.\\nThe Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order\\nto safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.\\nShirin Ebadi, Iran\\'s only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than\\nhuman rights.\\nMr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year.

Some examples of the work thus far:\\n• The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year.\\n• Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically, both through the\\nconsolidation of efforts under Tony Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) of\\nassistance contracts.\\n•\\n• Holbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels.\\n• The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of the\\nSwat refugee crisis.\\n•\\n• The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-border\\nissues.\\n)11\\n• Holbrooke\\'s international diplomacy — in the Gulf, with China, with the cadre of other\\nspecial representatives — has translated into funding and equipment commitments, more\\nbuy-in, and more patience.\\nHolbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan and\\nPakistan. Here are some examples:Ill\\nDefining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits)\\n• The regional approach championed by Holbrooke became a central feature of the Reidel\\nreport; the trilats are a pure Holbrooke invention\\nAfghanistan\\nThe clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced \"Afghanization\" -\\nprimarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF — as the preferable\\nalternative to adding more troops.\\n• The Reidel report calls for training 134,000 army and 82,000 police over two years;\\nHolbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers and\\nspeed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstacles,\\nparticularly with respect to the police.\\nFraming and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections:\\n•\\nDeveloping a strategy — in partnership with the Afghan government and others — for pursuing\\nreconciliation/reintegration.\\n• The Reidel report discusses support for the Afghan government\\'s efforts to reintegrate\\n\"non ideologically-committed\" insurgents who lay down their arms, renounce al Qaeda,\\nand accept the Afghan Constitution. Holbrooke was key in developing this aspect of the\\nreport, and is now working through the next phases.\\nPrioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdiction\\n• The Reidel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts — and the attendant\\nneed to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods.\\nEmphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies, China, and Turkey\\n• The Reidel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region. It\\ndoes not lay out a specific diplomatic strategy or priority countries.\\n• [NOTE:\\n• This issue does not get extensive treatment in the Reidel report.\\nPakistan\\n• The Reidel report does not speak in any detail to this issue.\\nResponding decisively to the refugee crisis in Swat and Buner\\n• Obviously, the Reidel report does not address this. The immediate response to the\\nrefugee crisis was Holbrooke\\'s team at its finest.\\nMaking the image of the United States in Pakistan as a critical strategic priority\\n• The Reidel report focuses on strategic communications in Afghanistan. Holbrooke\\'s\\nrecent trip with Judith McHale is the latest in an ongoing effort to develop a strategic\\ncommunications plan for Pakistan. Generally, Holbrooke, along with McDonough, has\\nbeen the key mover on all things related to strategic communications in both Afghanistan\\nand Pakistan; he has a good sense of what is missing and what is needed.\\nPursuing a major new energy initiative to address Pakistan\\'s economic troubles and boost\\nsupport for the United States\\n• The Reidel report mentions energy as a key sector where we should be encouraging\\nforeign investment.\\n1.

Triple checking the origins.\\nHillary Clinton Pledges to \\'Banish Sexual Violence\\'\\nOriginally posted Friday August 21, 2009 12:30 PM EDT\\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the former\\nFirst Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.\\nWhile much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton\\'s\\nthoughts on a trade issue (\"My husband is not the secretary of state, I am,\" she retorted), the emotional heart of her\\ntour was also her most dangerous stop — in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape\\nvictims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -\\nand what she will do about it.\\nWhat I Saw in Goma\\nBy Hillary Rodham Clinton\\nIn 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst — and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.\\nThe Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a\\nprovincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent\\nconflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal\\nmilitias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe\\nhaven.\\nNow they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whatever\\nglimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of their\\nhomes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity.\\nWomen and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence has\\nbecome a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with an\\naverage of 36 women and girls raped every day.\\nI visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months\\'\\npregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two of\\ntheir children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Then\\nthey beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn\\'t dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managed\\nto get her to the hospital — 85 kilometers away.\\nI came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and\\nabet them. They are crimes against humanity.\\nThese acts don\\'t just harm a single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves us\\ntogether as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.\\nBut there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.\\nWe have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen health\\ncare workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded\\nin Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have\\nbeen raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work.\\nCaregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded Heal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital in\\nBukavu, represent humanity at its best.\\nThe United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding to\\nprevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical care,\\ncounseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officers\\nto protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women and\\nfront-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. And\\nwe will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist\\nsurvivors of sexual violence.\\nWhile I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that the\\nperpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly important\\nwhen they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to commit\\nthese crimes with impunity.\\nOur commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will not\\nend with my departure.\\nWe are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in the\\neastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an\\nend to this conflict.\\nThere is an old Congolese proverb that says, \"No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come.\" The day must\\ncome when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children and\\ncollect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They are\\nstrong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make their\\ncountry both peaceful and prosperous.\\nWorking together, we will banish sexual violence into the dark past, where it belongs, and help the Congolese people\\nseize the opportunities of a new day.To state the very obvious, you are not only speaking as the Secretary of State, but as a mother to an audience of\\nmothers\\n---B6\\nJudiths best number\\n.zolTo close the loop: the 1,100/month statistic comes from a UNICEF report and is widely accepted/usedSusan rice would rather meet with you thurs So no call needed today\\nWWIAbedin, Huma <AbedinH@state.gov>\\nMonday, August 31, 2009 12:54 PM\\nH\\nB6Tom harkin called office twice during\\nCell:\\nHome:\\nAMCc: Oscar Flores\\nSenator kerry asking to talk.\\nAs you know he is overseas.

Will send PIR comments shortly.\\nTo: CDM\\nFr: Caitlin\\nRe: Branch Book\\nOverview:\\nThere are few surprises in this book. The \"surprises\" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick\\nup on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC\\'s crime bill and why he hadn\\'t disclosed\\ninformation about Lewinsky (because he hadn\\'t wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of\\nthings that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and\\nmuch more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as \"and this day, and the next day\" as My Life,\\nit does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that\\nthere appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,\\nWJC\\'s words are so interlaced with Branch\\'s recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC\\nquotes was far fewer than I had expected.\\nHRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with\\nBranch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the\\nGephardt comment, and didn\\'t grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC\\'s devotion to CVC, thought\\nthat there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much\\naligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in\\nthe book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...\\nBranch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion\\nof the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his\\nconnection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are\\nstrikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not\\nappear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren\\'t addressed. Much like My Life,\\none theme that repeated itself was WJC\\'s conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages\\nabout NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you\\nwould be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC\\'s acute allergies and his\\nchronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.\\nThe book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch\\ncould write that hadn\\'t been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D\\'Amato\\'s subpoena of CVC\\'s friends,\\nlater quashed, who slept over while HRC\\'s Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does\\nportray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks\\nWhitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from\\nWhitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone\\'s eye, such\\nas WJC referring to Paula Jones as \"a \\'new bimbo\\' he [WJC] didn\\'t even recognize.\"\\nBranch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no\\nother lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason\\nhe didn\\'t mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if\\nshe was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a\\nvery small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don\\'t recall hearing this\\nbefore. (This is addressed more fully below.)\\nThere are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC\\'s relationship\\nwith Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with\\nJanet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues\\nare discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed\\nin a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her\\nrelationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.\\nOn foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,\\nChina, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about\\nHaiti is about Branch\\'s own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion\\nabout North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in\\nwhat seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this\\nbook.\\nIn certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the\\nUSSS cancelled one stop because they would be \"defenseless\" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets\\nwould be lined with \"assassins.\" There are candid looks at WJC\\'s take on certain people and the relationship\\nbetween some, such as Albright and Berger\\'s dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin\\'s\\ndrinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.\\nOne thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders\\ngoing, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC\\'s\\nGephardt comment.\\nThe following items are addressed in the memo:\\nWen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4\\nWJC and Lewinsky\\'s Silence 4\\nHRC and Kissinger 4\\nHRC and gay/lesbian 5\\nTension with Moynihan 5\\nHRC as World Player 5\\nJesse Jackson 6\\nTension with Janet Reno 6\\nPortrayal of Carter 7\\nRelationship with Gore 8\\nOther (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, HRC and Haiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap,\\nSubpoenas of CVC\\'s Friends, Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex, Gore/HRC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin run\\nfor Senate, Trip to South Asia) 11\\nWen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill\\nIn discussing Wen Ho Lee\\'s release Branch characterizes WJC\\'s lack of knowledge about the strained\\ninterpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a \"confession.\" My Life\\nonly mentions Lee\\'s accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from\\nBranch\\'s book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.\\n➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security\\nagencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his\\npersonal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,\\nsolitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to\\nChina or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their\\ntreason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more\\nthan to establish Lee\\'s innocence. [Branch, 577]\\n➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others \"were being held in secret, uncharged\\nand untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without\\nforeseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the\\nlegal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his\\ndismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme\\ndetention had last three years. \\'I think it\\'s wrong,\\' he [WJC] said. \\'It\\'s not American. We accept guilty\\npeople on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.\\' [Branch, 629]\\nWJC and Lewinsky\\'s Silence\\nBranch writes that part of WJC\\'s motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could\\nsend her to jail, as she had denied it.\\n➢ \"Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of\\nthe affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could\\nhave turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while\\noriginal, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his\\nsteadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky\\'s account.\" [Branch, 511]\\nHRC and Kissinger\\nThe following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor\\nRoosevelt.\\n➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he\\ncomplained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn\\'t be able to see his own doctor. She continued to\\nsay \"it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His\\nvisage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because\\nthe Clinton health care bill was dying. \\'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,\\' she replied coolly. \\'Don\\'t be sure that it\\'s\\ndead. We\\'ll keep fighting, and there\\'s always light at the end of the tunnel.\\' She said Kissing blanched,\\nspeechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary\\'s dream, it registered that\\nhis strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...\\'That\\'s what I dreamed,\\'\\nHillary repeated, lost in thought. \\'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.\\'\\n[Branch, 179]\\nHRC and gay/lesbian\\nWriting about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC\\'s counsel got very \"exercised.\" WJC left\\nthe room. \"He was subdued on his return. \\'You know, I\\'ve had a lot more contact with gay people in my life\\nthan Hillary.\\' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues\\nwere even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.\\nOn the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation.\" [Branch, 551]\\nTension with Moynihan\\nThere are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC\\'s grievances and frustration with\\nMoynihan. For example:\\n> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could\\nfight for themselves, Branch writes, \"The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...\\'That\\'s just a\\nfreebie for him,\\' snapped Clinton, \\'and he knows it.\\'\" [p.140]\\n> In regard to health care: \"Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan\\nfor aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme.\" [p.170]\\n➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: \"She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a\\nnumber of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was\\nsure they had nothing to hide. \\'Why not have an investigation?\\' he often asked. She said Moynihan\\nskated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny\\nhimself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania\\nAvenue Development Corporation.\" [Brach, 182]\\n➢ \"Donnybrook\" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted\\nhypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, \"He doesn\\'t understand...that he\\'s\\nconceding the principles.\" WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press\\nand said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by \"feeding the beast of hostile presumption about\\nClinton\\'s motives.\" [Branch, 299]\\nHRC as World Player\\nThere are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several\\nexamples follow:\\n➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: \"They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the\\nClintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a\\ndelicate race between Hussein\\'s failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president\\nsaid he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water\\ndisputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein\\ngave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point.\" [Branch, 170]\\n> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, \"Her [HRC\\'s] schedule was far more\\ndemanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden\\nwomen.\" [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. \"By contrast with\\na superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in\\nexotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for\\ncitizenship groups and small-scale economic development.\" (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to\\na NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, \"she [HRC] played the traditional role of First\\nLady as wife and mother...\") [Branch, 246]\\n> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she\\ndepicted the \"harsh reality everywhere\" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the\\nrave reviews of HRC\\'s speech. [Branch, 289]\\n➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes \"Yeltsin seemed so removed from\\nurgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly.\" [Branch, 512-513]\\nJesse Jackson\\nBranch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact\\nwith her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs\\ngratitude, but the fact that Jackson \"counseled\" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.\\n➢ \"But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called\\nChelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was\\nanother story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in\\nAmerican politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much\\nher parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,\\nrage, or pray, he was always available.\" [Branch, 497]\\nTension with Janet Reno\\nThroughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative\\nopinion of Janet Reno.\\n> \"He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney\\ngeneral. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996\\ncampaign finance] would fall to Reno\\'s deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno\\'s\\nwholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a\\ntarget...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest\\nlike Nixon\\'s Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.\\nThat was not an option.\" [Branch, 388-389]\\n> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D\\'Amato and\\ncontinuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.\\nBranch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her\\n\"desire to stay on the job. \\'I told her I didn\\'t like that one damn bit,\\' the president said tersely. \\'I didn\\'t\\nhire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.\\'\" [Branch,\\n398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including\\ncoordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn\\'t blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,\\nbut that \"he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting\\nmandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno\\nhad failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension\\nthe entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her\\nmore naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her.\" [Branch, 399] He cites\\nthat Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second\\nterm.\\nPortrayal of Jimmy Carter\\nThere are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter\\'s trip to\\nNorth Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter\\'s seeming desire to be\\non the front lines.\\nNorth Korea:\\n➢ \"On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,\\nand Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea\\'s extreme\\nisolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow\\ninspection of North Korea\\'s nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.\\nThe only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding\\ngratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House\\nseething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,\\nand he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy \\'if the game were still in doubt.\\' [Branch,\\n162]\\nHaiti:\\n➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with\\nGore (who said Carter shouldn\\'t be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to\\nHaiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having \\'clientitis\\'\\n(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States\\' best interest). He\\ndidn\\'t want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to\\nthe press first. \"The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay\\nover at the White House, called CNN\\'s Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next\\nmorning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not\\nright...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent\\nnegotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to\\nClinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton\\nfound this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he\\nallowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to\\nspeak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States\\ngovernment complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but\\nClinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-\\nresident.\" [Branch, 200-201]\\nDispatch of Bombers Near Iraq\\n➢ \"He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and\\nBush. \\'Dole will support me,\\' he said. \\'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he\\ndoesn\\'t have much positive to say.\" [Branch, 518]\\nGore\\nFor the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore\\'s relationship. There are few places\\nwhere he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the\\nseemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.\\n➢ On page 92 Branch writes, \"No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as\\nalleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of \\'bad talkers\\': shy National Security Adviser\\nTony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les\\nAspin.\" [Branch, 92]\\n➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O\\'Leary and also\\nhaving Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other\\nnations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to\\nredeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC\\n\"pronounced them vital to Chelsea\\'s schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.\\n`Al,\\' Clinton told him, \\'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.\\' Gore\\nerupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still\\nwrangling about dates for Japan.\" Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw\\nLewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]\\n➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore\\'s sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as\\na team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.\\n➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second\\ncriminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is\\nabout a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.\\nThe exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.\\n➢ On Gore\\'s announcing his campaign. \"The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his\\nkickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were\\ntechnical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself\\nfrom Clinton\\'s personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.\\nThe president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton\\'s affair with Monica Lewinsky \\'inexcusable.\\'\\nFirst, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be\\nbadgered to death until he did. \\'Al,\\' Clinton told him, \\'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I\\nwould let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.\\'\" [Branch, 553-554]\\nBranch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his\\ncampaign. \"On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to\\nGore\\'s pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely\\nhow and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off\\nsubstance.\" [Branch, 554]\\n➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore\\'s campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not\\nsucceeding him. For example, \"Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,\\nexperience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential\\ncharacter over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore \"stiff,\" but Clinton discounted\\nthis liability. He thought Gore\\'s droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was\\nperceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to\\nemphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding\\nquality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature\\nfailed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word \"sunny.\" Gore needed more of it.\" [Branch, 599]\\n➢ He also complimented Gore\\'s knowledge of government workings. \"Gore knew Washington. Believe\\nme, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had\\nit not been for the vice president.\" He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who\\nwould be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into\\ngreat detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this\\nwas WJC\\'s emphasis versus Branch\\'s focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]\\n➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. \"They should be running\\nessentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would\\ntarnish them with Clinton\\'s character.\" [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC\\'s critique of Gore in debate\\nthat had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.\\n➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where \"Gore had bared himself in one\\nof their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he\\nmeant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend\\nthe two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He\\nhad the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow\\nwithout seeming to brag on his own record.\" [Branch, 623-624]\\n➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure\\nat first about recording the details. At the outset it says, \"For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did\\nhe blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him\\ndid.\" [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore\\'s use of him was proper—he was best in the\\nWhite House. Then he says, \"\\'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,\\'\"\\nClinton told Gore, \\'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,\\nnow that we\\'re being honest.\\'\" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that\\n\"Clinton\\'s drag plagued every direction.\" Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than\\nClinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an \"unparalleled\" vice\\npresident, but that he had \"blind spots.\" Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was\\n\"surreal.\"\\no Gore had a \"fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising\\nscandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal\\nintegrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said\\nhe had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that\\nhe found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the\\npresident was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for\\ntrouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the\\nensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. \\'I thought\\nhe was in Neverland,\\' he said.\" [Branch, 643-644]\\no Branch continues: \"The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported\\nClinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself\\ndisappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did\\nnot confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to\\nsay, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.\\nHe had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.\\nWell, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double\\ntake...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of\\nthem angry. Clinton exploded that Gore\\'s reaction was phony. What was so significant\\nhere?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed\\nhonesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton\\'s character was at the root of it...\" [Branch,\\n644-45]\\nOther\\n➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch\\'s book, it has WJC asking\\nMaggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty\\'s replacement. \"Williams was shrewd, discreet,\\nand efficient.\" [Branch, 161]\\n> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team\\'s\\nsuggestion to invade Haiti. \"He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her.

How our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial.\\nUnfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion,\\nincluding invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about \"death panels.\" As a result of these\\nattacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress\\nhave abandoned support for end-of-life counseling.\\nOur family\\'s experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and\\nthe misguidedness of the campaign against it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother and grandmother\\n-- had been fighting cancer for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerous\\nscans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy. Her doctors were among the\\nbest in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine points of, and latest\\nadvances in, pain management.\\nBrooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her\\nfamily for whatever time we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice and\\ntreatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington Home and Community Hospices. Their\\ningenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in her\\nfinal months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brooke\\nanticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and\\nexercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our family\\'s adjustment to it.\\nWhen her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully\\ninto the hands of Washington Home as an outpatient. Regular house calls by hospice doctors,\\nnurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects, spend time with\\nfriends and family, and end her life at home, which was a considerable comfort to her and to us.\\nThese, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling\\nthe cost of health care -- especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the current\\nnational debate. Therefore it is worth noting that Brooke\\'s treatment in the last stages of her\\nillness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year.\\nIt has often been said that dying can be a full-time job. That was emphatically not the case with\\nBrooke. Until her final days, she concentrated on living -- a choice that end-of-life counseling\\nhelped make possible. Hospice care more than meets the standard of the Hippocratic oath: It not\\nonly does no harm -- it does good; it is not about hastening death but enhancing life. If\\ncounseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform,\\nmany Americans will be as well.\\nDevin Talbott, along with his brother Adrian, is co-founder of GenerationEngage.

Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to the\\nUSA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment was\\nintended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators.\\nHis colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), spoke in opposition, agreeing with committee Chairman Patrick\\nLeahy (D-Vt.) and ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed.\\n\"I would just point to the actual language in here,\" Klobuchar said, \"which is, it\\'s not like this is some pie-in-\\nthe-sky standard here. I mean, it specifically says,\" she noted approvingly, reading aloud from the bill, that there\\nhave to be \"reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized national\\nsecurity investigation,\" and you can\\'t investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and there\\'s got\\nto be some suspected foreign agent involved.\\n\"So I just, for anyone listening to this, it is not like there is no standard,\" she concluded. \"There is a standard in\\nplace here.\"\\n\"That\\'s the standard that is in the bill now?\" Sessions asked.\\nKlobuchar nodded that it was.\\nNo it\\'s not, Durbin interrupted. \"Senator Klobuchar, you just read my amendment,\" not the bill, he said -- \"and I\\nthink it\\'s critically important that you understand what we\\'re establishing here.\"\\nWhatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment, which got only a handful of votes anyway.\\nBlame the gatekeeper\\nThe usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day of\\nwork and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heed\\ntheir expert advice. (They are, by nature, an optimistic crowd.)\\nThen, after 7 months, 8 days and 12 hours, on average, the grumbling begins that the secretary is \"not\\naccessible\" to senior career folks, that she\\'s overly protected by her personal staff, that the promised \"open\\ndoor\" has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing, usually at the secretary\\'s chief of staff. These days, that\\'s\\nCheryl Mills, who holds that post for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\\nWe\\'re hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staff,\\ncounselor, overseer of Haiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay, not really) --\\nhas made entry to Clinton\\'s suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad.\\nNot so, says Undersecretary of State William Burns, the department\\'s top career official. \"This secretary is in\\ntouch every day with as many people across the department as possible, and Cheryl is a big part of making that\\nhappen.\"\\nAnother senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in July and Africa in August and\\nIreland and Moscow just the other day, and soon she\\'ll be back on the road, pretty much until Thanksgiving.\\nThere have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters.\\nHey, just telling you what we\\'re hearing.\\nIn a timely fashion ...\\nThe Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department\\'s personnel bureau. The bureau,\\nin an Oct. 13 notice, said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West Lafayette,\\nInd., to \"assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have been\\nprofessionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatest\\npossibility of success in the foreign service.\"\\nWell, good thing the department\\'s only been hiring for a couple of hundred years.\\nThe rest of the résumé\\nThe White House last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie H. Roberson, a nuclear expert\\nand senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group, to be a member of the\\nDefense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous jobs, even her undergraduate degree in\\nnuclear engineering.\\nName sounds familiar. Roberson, Roberson: Wasn\\'t she Dubya\\'s appointee as assistant secretary of the Energy\\nDepartment for environmental management, the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That\\'s not\\nmentioned in the White House release, but she was there from 2001 to 2004.\\nWaterboarding for kids?\\nWGDB, Part II: Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal, Sen.\\nJohn Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it, Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federal\\ndeficits, which are not, for him, an abstraction.\\n\"It is deeply personal with me,\" Coburn explained. \"I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes, and I see the\\npotential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going to\\nwaterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to flood\\nthem with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities. We are going to limit their possibilities because we\\ndon\\'t have the courage to make the difference for their future.\"\\nWait a minute!

She and Ricardo\\nLagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.\\nWe will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday\\'s journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we\\nhave a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo\\nLagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt\\nabout our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.\\nYou should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its\\nAmerica\\'s column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did\\nthe same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He\\nand his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.\\nFinally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps.

Hague told you, relevant undercurrent to\\nEU debate. Sid\\nFrsOrn The Times\\nNovember 3, 2009\\nI suggest a night at the theatre, Mr Cameron\\nA sop to the party\\'s Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should be\\nashamed\\nDavid Aaronovitch\\nOn Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. The\\nplay was Our Class, by the Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek.\\nIn a series of short \"chapters\" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.\\nLike the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as the\\noccupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to the\\nmassacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.\\nThough the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10, 1941. As\\nPoland\\'s Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around the\\ntown singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axes\\nand cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barn\\nand locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from two\\nkilometres away; no one survived.\\nIn 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn\\'t been Germans, but\\nlocal Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jews\\nand their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne \"in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is\\nshattered by that crime\".\\nHistory matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the Tory-backed\\ngroup in the European Parliament. The party\\'s leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of\\n21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a big\\npart, of their political appeal.\\nBut despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. He\\nopposed it vigorously, associating himself with the \"Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne\". Among its\\nleading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending the\\nceremony at which the President apologised — said: \"These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible,\\nso why should we apologiSe?\"\\nMr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, the\\nmurders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone \"from the\\nJewish side\" apologised for how \"the Jews\" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month Mr\\nKaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. \"If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise\\nfor the crime made in Jedwabne,\" he said, \"you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish\\ncommunists did in Eastern Poland.\"\\nIt is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collective\\nJewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.\\nMr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to \"Jewish actions\" and allied himself with\\nthose who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet\\'s observation about patterns of\\nmassacre denial: \"it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us.\" Mr\\nKaminski\\'s view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the last\\nfew weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: \"I\\nshould apologise?\"\\nBut more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreign\\nsecretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician who\\nvehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron has\\ngot right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.\\nNow Tory columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collective\\nguilt, and to attacking non-existent \"smears\" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.\\nWhy?\\nIt is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whose\\nhistory is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. But\\nthese personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, for\\nexample, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that Mr\\nCameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists, by contrast,\\nis all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the British\\nConservatives.\\nSo why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn\\'t so bad really, and that Mr\\nKaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised his\\nEurophobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the \"federalist\" EPP, and that the logical\\noutcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.\\nWas it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain\\'s interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?\\nYou must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn\\'t really care enough about Europe to think\\nthrough the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he\\'s just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects,\\nthe Hannanites, the Cashists and the Redwoodians?\\nThis is the kind of advice I loathe, but I\\'ll say it anyway.

Sid\\nFrance: \\'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in\\nEurope\\'\\nFrench Europe minister says David Cameron\\'s pledge to reclaim EU powers is \\'pathetic\\' and will leave Britain isolated\\nNicholas\\',Nat, Patrick yVintpur and :15;rattori.\\nc.,uardiari.,;:o.uk, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT\\nThe Cohseri?t,vea were accused by the French government tonight of \"castrating\" Britain\\'s position within the EU by\\nadopting an \"autistic\" approach that would take Britain off the radar.\\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France\\'s Europe minister, described as \"pathetic\" the Tories\\' EU plans\\nannounced today, warning they would not succeed \"for a minute\".\\nGiving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so\\'far only been expressed in private, Lellouche — who said he was\\nreflecting Nicolas Sarkozy\\'s \"sadness and regret\" — accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a \"bizarre\\nautism\" in their discussions.\\nHe said: \"They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism.\"\\nLellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy\\'s government, made his remarkable intervention after David\\nCaii.e.con outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.\\nA future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Over\\nsocial and employment legislation, the Tory leader said.\\nCameron said he was not seeking an immediate \"bust-up\" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers\\nnegotiations to last as long as five years.\\nBut that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party\\'s legal affairs spokesman\\nin Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become \"self-governing\".\\nFrance\\'s centre-right government condemned Cameron\\'s plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU.\\nAbandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: \"It\\'s pathetic. It\\'s just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,\\njust cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the result\\nof a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short.\" He said Cameron\\'s approach\\nwas in line with the Tories\\' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament, of which\\nSarkozy\\'s UMP party is a member.\\n\"They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in\\nthe European parliament,\" he said.\\nLellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a \"waste of time for all of us\".\\n\"I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you\\'re going to be all by\\nyour self and you\\'ll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,\\nyou go for it. But it\\'s a waste of time for all of us,\" the French minister said.\\nLellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. \"It\\'s not going to happen for a minute.\\nNobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again.\\nIt\\'s going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that,\" he said. \"It is a time of tumultuous waters all\\naround us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic crisis. It is time\\nwhen the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world\\'s GDP capable of fighting\\nit out on climate, on trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.\\n\"We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you\\'re big\\nor small, the lessbn is the same. And [Britain\\'s] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance.\" He explained: \"Finally we have\\ninstitutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate\".\\nIn a sign of France\\'s determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French\\nwould attempt to reduce Britain\\'s EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.\\nHe pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.\\n\"If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the\\nrelationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of\\ncourse finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate. That\\nshould tell you quite a bit huh?\" he said.\\nCameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the short\\nterm he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provoke\\ncries, of betrayal on his backbenches.\\nHague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche\\'s comments did not represent the true reception of the\\nTories\\' plans in Europe.\\n\"That is not how we are seen across Europe,\" he told BBC2\\'s Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations\\nwith Sarkozy\\'s party.\\n\"1 don\\'t think you will find that\\'s representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals,\" he added.sbwhoeor\\nThursday, November 5, 2009 12:40 AM\\nH\\nMemo: agenda for Merkel, transatlantic economic council we discussed. Sid\\nhrc memo merkel transatlantic council 110509.docx\\nNovember 5, 2009\\nFor: HillaryI\\'ve attached the gorgeous cover as a PDF\\nHillary\\'s Moment: Clinton Faces the World\\nBy Joe Klein\\nTime Magazine\\nWednesday, Nov. 04, 2009\\nIt was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. \"We\\'re prepared to start\\npeace talks immediately,\" the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary\\nClinton standing at his side, poker-faced. \"I think we should ... get on it and get with it.\"\\nIt was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their\\nleader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West\\nBank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a\\npartial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was\\na nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an \"unprecedented\" offer,\\nNetanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)\\nIt was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had\\nsoftened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli\\n\"restraint\" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration\\'s retreat, agreeing that\\nNetanyahu\\'s proposal was, indeed, \"unprecedented,\" even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most\\nimportant thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the\\nPalestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration\\'s retreat. Their Arab\\nneighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan \"falls far short\" of\\nU.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it \"unprecedented,\" which was neither diplomatic nor wise.\\nSuddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on\\nNetanyahu\\'s proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,\\nprivately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration\\'s mission was to get the parties into peace talks\\nwithout preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton\\nhad violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former\\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright.)\\nClinton\\'s Three Qualities\\nFor the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go\\nto Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there \"guardedly optimistic\" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the\\nIsraelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The\\nbreakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he\\'d be willing to go to\\nJerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone\\'s surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and\\nreach what appears to be a breakthrough — they\\'re talking! — which then becomes another dead end.\\nThe job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,\\nis still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,\\ndiplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the\\nNational Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton\\'s recent predecessors have\\ndistinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was\\nRichard Nixon\\'s schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James\\nBaker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush\\'s best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have\\nbeen frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we\\'re talking about — the second most popular American in\\nthe world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking\\nheadline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.\\nIt is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The\\nconventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton\\'s\\nreticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the\\nheavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she\\nbecomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration\\'s policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.\\nColin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the\\nObama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum\\nlooms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?\\nTraditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the\\nstriped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign\\nindicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian\\nidealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem\\nindicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.\\nThere are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of\\ndepartmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy\\n— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the\\noffice since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand\\nand interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an\\ninternational celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to\\nthe President\\'s — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.\\nShe has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although\\nher performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed\\ntentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,\\nClinton\\'s cautious formality took a backseat to Gates\\' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems\\nfar more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton\\'s\\ncampaign.)\\nIndependence and Candor\\nIn the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the\\nbehest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.\\nIn the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her\\nindependence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after\\nan opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — \"Can\\'t we all just get along?\" — phase.\\nDuring her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been\\nunprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan\\nspecialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had\\nbeen bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan\\'s moderate Islamic majority. \"We\\nsaw her praying there,\" an academic named Shala Aziz told me, \"and, for the first time, I\\'m thinking, The Americans have\\nhearts.\"(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)\\nThe big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts\\nand Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the\\nPakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press\\naccounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State\\'s getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton\\'s\\nundiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,\\nhad begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the\\nPakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast\\nwas especially sharp after George W. Bush\\'s eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez\\nMusharraf. \"In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home,\" said Farahnaz\\nIspahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. \"Clinton\\'s willingness to meet with everyone, hostile\\nor not, has made a big impression — and because she\\'s Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it\\nmeans so much more.\"\\nTransformative Experience\\nThere are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and\\nClinton\\'s — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.\\nEarlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album\\nof photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and\\ndaughter Chelsea. \"It did bring tears to my eyes,\" Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,\\n\"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ...\" She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,\\ntalking about the \"reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all.\"\\nClinton\\'s first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I\\nbelieve, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when\\nwe set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994\\ncongressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very\\npersonal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.\\nPrivately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was\\nChelsea\\'s spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy\\nczar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously\\nridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.\\n\"That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable,\" Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her\\nJerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing\\nglasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. \"I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I\\'ve\\ndone since,\" she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.\\nConference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: \"Women\\'s rights are human\\nrights.\"(See photos of Beijing\\'s changing skyline.)\\nClinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years\\nof insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.\\nWhen her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside\\nBhutto\\'s hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. \"She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar\\nkameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did\\nanything like that,\" Clinton says.\\nWhen Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because\\nBhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking\\nBhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, \"I used to be able\\nto walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can\\'t.\" When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —\\n\"The Saudis,\" who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto\\'s acquiescence to, and\\nparticipation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so\\ninadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto\\'s assassination in 2007.)\\nIronically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton\\'s interests — microfinance, education and\\nhealth care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State\\nDepartment but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -\\nschools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military\\'s efforts to secure the population. As a result, there\\nwas immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army\\'s counterinsurgency\\nmanual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At\\none point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential\\nDemocratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, \"You mean, aside from Hillary?\"\\nIt was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke (\"my two alpha males,\" she calls them) for the first time -\\nat her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the\\nmilitary while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than\\nusual — although Defense Secretary Gates\\' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn\\'t hurt. In\\nfact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton\\'s relationship with the White House staff.\\nClinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID\\ndirector, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. \"It was all sorts of niggling things,\" says a Clinton adviser, \"like, Farmer had\\nat one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the\\namount was illegal.\"\\nAnother of Clinton\\'s military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, \"I\\'m a Republican. I disagree with her\\nabout practically everything, but she\\'d make a hell of a Commander in Chief.\" There is a palpable toughness to the\\nwoman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President\\'s instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest\\nexchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the \"bluster\" of George W. Bush\\nafter she said the U.S. would be able to \"obliterate\" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton\\'s edgier tone\\nhas been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli\\nsettlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted \"to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not\\noutposts, not natural-growth exceptions.\" And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a\\nrhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read \"Clinton\\'s Collateral Damage.\")\\nThe White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps\\nremoved from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:\\nwhenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of\\nthe room. Despite Netanyahu\\'s momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the\\nde facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.\\nHillary\\'s Choice\\nThe tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in\\nsubstantive agreement on the President\\'s diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is\\nwilling to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;\\nneither Obama\\'s gauziness nor Clinton\\'s inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing\\nperception that the Administration\\'s policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems\\nready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there\\'s no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain\\nrecalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on\\nhuman rights with no apparent quid pro quos.\\nThe White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will\\nreturn to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for \"strategic patience.\" But the only thing Obama\\nreally has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have\\nrefrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -\\nthe Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda\\'s leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this\\nAdministration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn\\'t happen\\novernight, but for Obama\\'s policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be\\nexplained to the public.\\nThere is also a growing sense that the President\\'s inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which\\nrepresents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but\\nin his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace\\nhunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran\\'s Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;\\nif it doesn\\'t, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is\\naccompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. \"You can\\'t be seen pushing countries around — demanding\\n[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results,\" says Leslie\\nH. Gelb, author of Power Rules. \"The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they\\'ll begin to take\\nyou less seriously.\" (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)\\nClinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise\\nfor the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also\\nburblings and emanations from Clinton\\'s staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for\\nthe Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the\\nuncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton\\'s occasional overseas gaffes.\\nThese tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that\\nthe Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New\\nYork, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,\\nthough, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President\\'s\\nprimary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials\\nhave spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. \"Either\\nyou have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President,\" says a former\\nRepublican Secretary of State, \"or there is no message.\"(See photos from eight months of Obama\\'s diplomacy.)\\nAides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton\\'s staff acknowledged\\nthat she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television\\nis a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely\\nguarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President\\'s alter ego\\non foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama\\'s national-security team is Gates — but he\\'s a\\nRepublican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones\\nhas settled in as National Security Adviser, but he\\'s not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign\\npolicy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.\\nClinton\\'s value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning\\nthe $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. \"How much damage control\\nhave you been able to do on this trip?\" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton\\'s\\nmeeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. \"I don\\'t know,\" she\\nsaid. \"I hope some.\"\\nAfterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. \"Well, this trip was long overdue,\" she said. \"The Pakistani\\npeople really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone\\nattacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the\\ndamage control\" — she paused, thinking it through — \"I\\'d have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot.\"\\nIn the end, though, Clinton\\'s success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.\\nShe will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who\\nknows where he wants to go in the world but hasn\\'t quite figured out how to get there.Nice!fyiOf course.

The answer, of course, is no,\\nbecause this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghan\\nexperience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure Afghanistan doesn\\'t change the equation, at least\\nnot significantly.\\nThe popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion times\\nover the last eight years, replete with terrorist \"trainees\" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggy\\npantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds.\\nAl-Qaida doesn\\'t need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.\\n11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates of\\nPakistan\\'s madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatient\\nmaidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida\\'s \"martyrs\" don\\'t need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In fact,\\nto be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.\\nAl-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact, those who follow events in\\nAfghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that\\'s\\nwhere al-Qaida. is. They haven\\'t been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved to\\nPakistan\\'s tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstituted\\nTaliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-Qaida was not interested in its now\\ninsecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan\\'s current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal\\nareas is successful, al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives are\\nwidely scattered in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America.\\nAs alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/is\\ndoing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn\\'t extend much beyond their capitals\\nwill do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincial\\ntowns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet\\'s thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites will\\ndo/are doing it.\\nOsama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefs\\ncompound somewhere near Quetta, the capital of Pakistan\\'s constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, which\\nhas 48 percent of the country\\'s land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida central\\nissuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.\\nIf the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of \"no more Sept. lls,\" what are the United\\nStates and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come, the\\nTaliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11, 2001, there was\\npalpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden was\\nissuing \"too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn\\'t complete his religious\\neducation.\" Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost power\\nand his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.\\nIn today\\'s Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizen\\nhas seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. effort\\nhas been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among many\\nothers came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY, a\\nFlorida-based company, to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for AK-47s. All\\nrequirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces, were removed. Thus AEY\\nwas able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chinese\\nammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.\\nThe State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEY\\nand its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.\\nWherever U.S. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPost\\nreporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are not\\ndisrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul that\\nreviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.\\nIf true, the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban to\\nfight the Afghan government.\\nThe key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. These\\nare the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as the\\nmilitary takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq and\\nAfghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, after\\nauthorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.\\nIn a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket.sbwhoeop\\nThursday, November 5, 2009 10:51 AM\\nH\\nIn case no one shows you this from Foreign Policy today.

That\\'s more than Vice President Joe\\nBiden, who\\'s currently next in line for the presidency.\\nAccording to the poll, 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House, with seven in 10 saying the\\nformer Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified.\\nThe survey indicates that a majority of Republicans, 54 percent, feel Palin is qualified, with 44 percent indicating she\\nisn\\'t. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president, with 68 percent\\ndisagreeing. According to the poll, nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified.\\nThe poll\\'s release comes one day before the release of Palin\\'s book, \"Going Rogue: An American Life.\"\\n\"The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOP\\nnomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee,\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.\\nAccording to the survey, nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president, with 43 percent feeling\\nthe same way about Huckabee. Among Republicans, Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63\\npercent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified, 9 points higher than the number that say the same of\\nPalin.\"\\nPalin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician, that she\\ncares about average Americans, and that she is honest and trustworthy,\" says Holland. \"But the perception that she is\\nnot qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel.\"An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Monday\\nindicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palin\\'s qualified to serve as president, with six in 10 saying she\\'s not qualified.\\nThe CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office,\\n17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Biden\\'s qualified to take over as president.Biden\\'s low\\nnumber may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Biden\\npersonally.\"\\nIn the past, poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president,\" say\\nHolland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president, but only if\\nrespondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications, he\\nadds. In the Bush administration, the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as the\\nadministration grew more unpopular. \"Cheney\\'s experience in office didn\\'t change during that period - attitudes toward\\nthe Bush/Cheney administration did,\" he says.\\nHillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates, including health care,\\nthe economic stimulus, and other controversial matters, while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy,\\nHolland adds, while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes - \"which might explain why some\\nrespondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep.\"\\nThe CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by\\ntelephone.

Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them\\nrather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.\\nMr. Heyman\\'s death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart\\nsurgery.\\nMr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical\\ncompany that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.\\nA group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun\\noff GAF\\'s chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.\\nDuring that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But\\nafter Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF\\'s management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: \"There\\nis a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow.\"\\nMr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping\\nmalls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.\\n\"He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did,\" said Leon Black, the chairman of\\nApollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman\\'s investment banker.\\nMr. Black added: \"He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce\\nnegotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his\\ncompanies, his real estate, his art collection or his family.\"\\nMr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate\\ndeveloper. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice\\nDepartment under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut.

They plan to double the amount of foreign aid.\\n11 The agency will play a key role in the administration\\'s efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where\\nofficials believe the civilian component must be strengthened.\\n$ But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now, with several prime candidates\\'\\nwithdrawing from consideration amid a White House vetting process that Clinton denounced in July as\\n\"ridiculous,\" \"a nightmare,\" and \"frustrating beyond words.\"\\n$ Shah, 36, whose family immigrated to the U.S. from India, is now the Under Secretary for Research,\\nEducation and Economics and Chief Scientist at the Agriculture Department where he manages a budget\\nof more than $2.6 billion and more than 10,000 staff around the world.\\n¶ Before that, he had several positions at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including managing its\\n$1.5 billion contribution to a global vaccination fund and helping launch the foundation\\'s Global\\nDevelopment program where he oversaw a $1.3 billion investment portfolio.\\nThe lingering USAID vacancy, particularly after several leading candidates pulled out, had upset\\ndevelopment experts and Congress.

Sid\\nHas Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?\\nBy Andy McSmith\\nLord Mandelson\\'s attack shines spotlight on Tory leader\\'s\\nlinks with media mogul\\nDavid Cameron has been accused of making a \"contract\" with Britain\\'s biggest media company to trade political support\\nbefore an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.\\nThe accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, who is increasingly the public face of\\nGordon Brown\\'s government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all this\\nweek over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.\\nThey suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit the\\ncommercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the paper\\'s aggressive support for the Tories is\\na pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.\\nExamples of the apparent tie-in between what News International\\'s boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what David\\nCameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of \"top slicing\" the\\nBBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regional\\ntelevision companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectively\\nagainst Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire.\\nWhen the policy was abandoned in September, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was because\\nenacting it might make the commercial television companies \"focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies\".\\nThere was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will freeze the\\nlicence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC\\'s income will be capped, without the regional television companies seeing\\nany government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britain\\'s only satellite television company, Sky. \"This\\nwas done for News International,\" a Tory insider said yesterday. \"Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC.\\nHe doesn\\'t want the independent companies strengthened.\"\\nIn April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after taking\\nover as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that a\\nConservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.\\nLast summer James Murdoch attacked the \"abysmal record\" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over see\\nthe BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival, singling out its \"total failure\" to stop the BBC buying the Lonely\\nPlanet travel guides, a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an \"egregious\" invasion of private enterprise by the state.\\nLess than two months later, Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust.\\nIn the same lecture, Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that \"no\\ncommercial competitor can afford\". He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey, a shadow media minister,\\npromised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.\\nLord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had \"effectively formed a contract, over\\nthe head, incidentally, of the newspaper\\'s editor and their readers, in which they are sort of bound to one another\".\\nSpeaking to the BBC\\'s Today programme, he added: \"What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election is\\none part of the contract and, presumably, what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is the\\nother side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way, this is then followed\\nup by Sky News, which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit.\"\\nThis was \"absolutely, categorically\" denied yesterday by The Sun\\'s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, who accused Lord\\nMandelson of talking \"preposterous nonsense\".\\nThe Sun, which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blair\\'s leadership, announced that it was\\njumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in September.\\nIts onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressive\\nattack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992\\ngeneral election, a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan \"It was The Sun wot won it\".\\nBut there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown, who is blind in one eye, has\\nadmitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, was killed by a\\nmakeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.\\nA poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome, whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord\\nAshcroft, found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun\\'s attack was \"inappropriate\" compared with 23 per\\ncent who thought it was \"legitimate\".\\nThe closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation, from an inside source, that David Cameron\\npersonally consulted the editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, in three separate conversations before he abandoned his\\n\"cast-iron\" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.\\nMr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper has\\ncampaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of The\\nSun that Cameron first made his guarantee, two years ago.\\nHis announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in\\'the Daily Mail, but in The\\nSun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline \"Cameron\\'s crusade for UK rights\".\\nThe person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch, not his father, Rupert, who created The Sun\\nvirtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he \"regretted\" his\\nson\\'s decision to turn against Gordon Brown, \"who is a friend of mine\", but defended it on the grounds that Brown has\\nbeen a \"disappointment\".\\nYesterday, The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, announced that its veteran political editor, Phil Webster, is leaving\\nthe Commons, where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. His\\nreplacement, Roland Watson, was a friend of David Cameron\\'s at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories.\\nTom Newton Dunn, newly appointed as The Sun\\'s political editor, is another Old Etonian. His father, Bill, used to be a\\nTory MEP, but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.\\nIndependent News and Media LimitedLinda Dewan is out of the office/back on Monday, November 16November 12, 2009 - Dems Fade In Ohio Senate Race, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Obama Gets\\nNegative Score In Key Swing State\\nWord format\\nFor the first time, Republican Rob Portman is inching ahead of the two Democrats in the 2010 race for Ohio\\'s\\nU.S. Senate seat, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.

Sid\\nReturn to the Article\\nNovember 13, 2009\\nCan the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?\\nBy Sean Trende\\nJohn Judis and Ruy Teixeira\\'s well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in\\nVirginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to\\nupper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if\\nimitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.\\nDemocrats did build coalitions similar to Warner\\'s, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner\\'s\\ncoalition was essentially Bill Clinton\\'s 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily\\nsuccessful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election\\nof the most liberal President in American History last year.\\nGiven this background, it\\'s only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in\\nVirginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (though\\nnot the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the\\nGOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assembly\\nraces by fewer than 1,000 votes.\\nThere are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week\\'s election, it\\'s silly to argue that the GOP brand is\\ntoo damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats\\' latest spin — that their weakness\\namong Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their\\nRepublican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans\\' low self-identification is a salient factor in\\nelections.\\nBut the most important lesson is this: while there\\'s little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of\\nthe mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia\\'s primacy in the story of Democratic\\ncoalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it\\'s not a pretty one for Democrats.\\nThe historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:\\nCulturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began\\nbreaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party\\'s embrace of unions, blacks and\\nliberals is a story is so well known there\\'s no need to rehash it here.\\nBut this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,\\nurban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a\\nmoderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a\\ncombination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation\\nfor Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the\\nRepublican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by\\neight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.\\nClinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don\\'t like it when you call\\nsomeone \"macaca,\" and aren\\'t crazy about the religious right. But they\\'re generally not particularly socially liberal either,\\nand are fans of \"law and order.\" They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean\\nenvironment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced\\nbudgets are the ultimate \"good government\" indicator for these voters.\\nClinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.\\nIn so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic\\ngrowth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the \"Carter\" label for the Democrats. This,\\nin turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -\\none that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.\\nGeorge W. Bush\\'s presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite\\'s nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,\\na fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more\\nheavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,\\nmajor metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put\\ntogether a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.\\nThe mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.\\nBut the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party\\'s grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the\\nstage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama\\nreceived 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters\\' attitude toward Bush\\'s Presidency.\\nObama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the\\nremaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn\\'t as broad as Clinton\\'s, it was deeper. Faced with\\nvanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush\\'s presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were\\nenthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black\\nPresident.\\nBut this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,\\npoor blacks, and upper class liberals isn\\'t easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the\\nparty gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the\\ndoor, the party isn\\'t left with much.\\nWe see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday\\'s elections, especially in Virginia. Let\\'s backtrack to 2001, and look at\\nthe counties that Mark Warner won.\\nThe coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton\\'s. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the\\nmining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites\\nin the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,\\nbut it worked.\\nNow let\\'s compare Warner\\'s map with Obama\\'s map in 2008:\\nThe suburbs stayed in the Democrat\\'s camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area\\nbecomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,\\nand Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in\\nduring the 1920s.\\nAs I said, this isn\\'t a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than\\nObama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the\\nJacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — at\\nleast on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn\\'t happen, obviously. Let\\'s look at how Virginia\\nchanged from Bush\\'s 2000 election to Deeds\\' loss last week:\\nThe redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward\\nDemocrats.\\nWe see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC\\nsuburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton\\nRoads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush\\'s 54% in\\n2004 and McDonnell\\'s 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the\\nticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican.\\nWe can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let\\'s\\ncompare Deeds\\' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at \"relative movement.\" Because\\neverything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing \"movement\" would be solid dark red, and not of\\nmuch use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved\\nless than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties\\' PVI].\\nWe see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven\\'t\\nmoved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern\\nportion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This\\nsuggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.\\nNow let\\'s look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so\\ndramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at \"relative\" shifts.\\nThe western counties of the state didn\\'t shift much from 2008, but that\\'s because they were already giving Republicans\\naround 70% of the vote — there wasn\\'t much room for Republican growth (and remember, \"blue\" in a relative map still\\nmeans slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in\\nthe DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.\\nIn other words, the Jacksonians aren\\'t returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to\\nwin without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the\\nClinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.\\nThis is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is\\nvery, very little left for them. And there\\'s reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama\\'s fiscal policy, to\\nmake an understatement, hasn\\'t been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion\\ndollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade\\nmake suburbanites shudder. They don\\'t much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at\\nsome point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first\\nyear, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don\\'t put much stock in Candidate Obama\\'s promise to\\nenact a net spending cut any more.\\nDemocrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds\\' inept campaign. Deeds wasn\\'t a great candidate, but when the\\nmood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out\\nwhen he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death\\npenalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18\\npoints, even holding everything else equal.\\nThe other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in\\nthe House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs\\nvoted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn\\'t give the Republican 60% of the vote like\\nit did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd\\nWhitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative\\nRepublicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the\\noutskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats\\' capture of that body figures\\nprominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive\\nthere with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen\\nhis attack ads on McDonell\\'s thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.\\nStates with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven\\'t moved\\nmuch against Democrats. Obama\\'s polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and\\nSenator, in classic \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of\\ncourse in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he\\'s below 40%.\\nThis doesn\\'t mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other\\nfactors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls\\nto enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama\\'s victory is starting to\\nshow its downside for downticket Democrats.\\nThe Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn\\'t improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find\\nthemselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.\\nSean Trende can be reached at strende@realclearpolitics.com.\\nPage Printed from:\\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.comiarticles/2009111/13/can_the_clinton_coalition_survivethe_age_of_obama_99046\\n.html at November 13, 2009 - 08:19:49 AM CSTYesIhave a copy.Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nFriday, November 13, 2009 4:06 PM\\nH\\nFW:\\nRELEASE IN PART\\nB6\\nfyitomorrow.http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-11-22/think-before-you-travel/?cid=hp:mainpromo2\\nThe White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps.

Gelb\\nNovember 22, 2009 I 10:50pm\\nThe Asia trip was not worth Obama\\'s time. Leslie H. Gelb on why the president should shake up his\\nforeign policy team—and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home.\\nPresident Obama\\'s nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems, past and future. First, the trip\\'s\\nlimited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America\\'s power. On top of\\nthe inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations, the message for Mr. Obama\\nshould be clear: He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and, more so, at his own dominant role in\\ndecision-making. Something is awry somewhere, and he\\'s got to fix it.\\nSecondly, the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world\\'s\\nmost dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralism\\nand mutual understanding. He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and trade\\nproblems. Otherwise, most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States.\\nA meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week\\'s commentary. Unbelievably, some criticized\\nObama for not getting China to \"throw its weight around.\" What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Others\\nlamented that Obama couldn\\'t make \"demands\" on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king, and\\nthat Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around,\\nand that China is not now ruling the roost (more accurately, it\\'s sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obama\\ncontinued his pattern of trashing America\\'s friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It\\'s hard to stomach\\nthis nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for accommodating China and\\nalienating America\\'s allies.\\nSome analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect \"deliverables\"\\non the trip, and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia\\'s new importance and America\\'s desire for a new co-\\noperative spirit. That\\'s a commendable thought, but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president\\'s time (when\\nyou consider preparations)— especially when he\\'s got a tanking economy, health-care reform woes, and decisions to\\nmake on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments on\\ncertain issues that can\\'t be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact, most presidents\\nwouldn\\'t even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during the\\nvisit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned for\\nRichard Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for George H. W. Bush by James Baker.\\nObama\\'s travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, and\\nthe fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa, which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce ways\\nto gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing would\\nactually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and North\\nKorean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these, Mr. Obama should have taken a well-\\ndeserved vacation in Hawaii.\\nMatters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan\\'s emperor. He seems to do\\nthis stuff spontaneously and inexplicably, as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunate\\nthat Obama and his aides didn\\'t flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television and\\nmeet with non-stacked Chinese groups—as has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing\\'s leaders\\nobviously didn\\'t feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such access. But he\\nand his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste.\\nThe Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world\\'s most dynamic\\neconomic region, and Mr. Obama missed it.\\nThe White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But\\nState\\'s role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department\\'s senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,\\nsurely knew better.

If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia\\njourney and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside\\ncounselors or outside advisers.\\nIf most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip, here\\'s what they would have\\nadvised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation, and stop invoking the\\nGod of Multilateralism without spelling out America\\'s leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateral\\norganizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asian\\nDevelopment Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation\\nOrganization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) and ASEAN, the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations are\\nincreasingly organizing themselves into these groups, and Washington hasn\\'t really figured out its role. Most Asian\\nnations want that role to be a prominent one—in fact, the leadership position. They\\'re afraid of China, afraid that China\\nwon\\'t be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time, they don\\'t want\\nWashington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out a\\nleadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest.\\nThey want an America they remember, one that can get things done and doesn\\'t let problems fester.\\nThat U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama\\'s trip. Washington played architect and solidified its\\nleadership in Europe after World War II with NATO, the Marshall Plan, and various trade and economic organizations like\\nthe World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in the\\nnew Pacific Era.\\nLeslie H.

Wrong. Conditions in the U.S. labor markets are awful and worsening. While the official\\nunemployment rate is already 10.2% and another 200,000 jobs were lost in October, when you include discouraged\\nworkers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping 17.5%.\\nWhile losing 200,000 jobs per month is better than the 700,000 jobs lost in January, current job losses still average more\\nthan the per month rate of 150,000 during the last recession.\\nAlso, remember: The last recession ended in November 2001, but job losses continued for more than a year and half until\\nJune of 2003; ditto for the 1990-91 recession.\\nSo we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of 2010 at the earliest. In other words, if you are unemployed\\nand looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner, you had better hunker down. All the economic\\nnumbers suggest this will take a while. The jobs just are not coming back.\\nThere\\'s really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around: a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with\\nanother round of labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state and local governments\\nand provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers. Helping the unemployed just by extending\\nunemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient; it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation.\\nThe long-term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now as\\na way of sharing the pain, many firms are telling their workers to cut hours, take furloughs and accept lower wages.\\nSpecifically, that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another 3 million full time jobs lost on top of the 7.5 million jobs\\nformally lost.\\nThis is very bad news but we must face facts. Many of the lost jobs are gone forever, including construction jobs, finance\\njobs and manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest that a quarter of U.S. jobs are fully out-sourceable over time to other\\ncountries.\\nOther measures tell the same ugly story: The average length of unemployment is at an all time high; the ratio of job\\napplicants to vacancies is 6 to 1; initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions of\\nunemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer.\\nBased on my best judgment, it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to 11% and will remain at a very\\nhigh level for two years or more.\\nThe weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and an\\nanemic recovery of the economy, and increases the risk of a double dip recession.\\nAs a result of these terribly weak labor markets, we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth;\\nlarger budget deficits; greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home and\\ncommercial real estate prices; greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estate\\nmortgages, and in credit cards, auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks; and greater\\nprotectionist,pressures.\\nThe damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now.\\nRoubini is professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University and Chairman of Roubini\\nGlobal Economics.\\nRead more: http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/11/15/2009-11-\\n15 the worst is yet to come unemployed americans should hunker down for more job lo.html?print=1&paqe=all#i\\nxzz0WwHGikNII met with Steve.\\nWe had a good cony and discussed a number of areas of focus, most of which are WI.\\nTake a look and flag any concerns.\\nI am going to discuss with Jack this am.\\nCdmcalling1.4(D)\\nB1\\nHeading home after visit to Bangladesh where you are remembered with great affection and where they are eager to\\nhave you make a return visit.\\nIt was a reunion for me in many ways -- the experiences from \\'95 still vivid, and it was a positive message that I came 1.4(B)\\nback! 1.4(D)\\nB1\\nOur amb there is terrific.

As has become fashionable to note, events have instead obliged\\nBarack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan.\\nThat analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly, the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just how\\ndependent the US has become on foreign creditors, chief among them China.\\nIt has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway, the relative decline of a US-centric west and\\nthe relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China, poor and riddled with internal\\ncontradictions, is not there yet, by a very long way.\\nThe changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumbling\\nfor the right one. Take global imbalances.\\nIn the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour — delivered in Japan, perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is not\\nabandoning Tokyo just yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business as\\nusual. \"One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on American\\nconsumers and Asian exports to drive growth,\" he said.\\nThat is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publicly\\nsceptical about the US\\'s long-term finances.\\nFrom China\\'s perspective, Mr Obama\\'s emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans to\\nspend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place.\\nThat explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay for\\nhealthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary, as well as fiscal, policy.\\nOn the eve of the US president\\'s visit, Liu Mingkang, China\\'s chief banking regulator, took a swipe at the US Federal\\nReserve, saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is a\\nbit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent of\\ngross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it can\\naddress a humbled superpower.\\nMr Obama\\'s efforts to occupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism, particularly\\nhis decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres.\\nHis administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy — and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business-\\noriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction.\\nWhen it comes to human rights, too, the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth its\\nchief creditor.\\nHillary Clinton, secretary of state, set the tone early when she said that human rights should not \"interfere\" with matters of\\nimplicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet, Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his Tokyo\\nspeech. There was also not a single mention of India, a potential regional counterweight to China, yet another indication\\nthat Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear Mr\\nObama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on Monday — though even that could not\\nundo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week\\'s trip.\\nIt is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama\\'s assurances that China\\'s rise\\nneed not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token, US accommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to common\\nperception, China\\'s huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependent\\nChinese growth has been on the US consumer.\\nEqually, any idea that China, with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the same\\nas Angola\\'s, can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. He need not — and\\nmust not — kowtow.\\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2009. Print a single copy of this article for personal use.

Author\\nof the Council Special Report, Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis.\\nNovember 16, 2009\\nhttp://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=°/02Fregion%2F271%2Fchina\\nMany myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four, in particular, stand out, and\\nit is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. The\\nfact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the United\\nStates is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly, since China is a major source for U.S.\\nimports, U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition, the Chinese authorities have\\nemphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability in\\nChina is bad, with adverse implications for the rest of the world.\\nTaken together, these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States\\n(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies, especially its exchange rate policy, to facilitate the\\nrebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake, and that is why during his trip to Asia,\\nPresident Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes in\\nChina. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit in\\nPittsburgh in September 2009.\\nMyth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main \"banker\" for the United States\\nChina holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China\\'s $2.3 trillion in official reserves, it is estimated that\\n70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America\\'s banker. Nor is the\\nUnited States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries, there are other\\nwilling public and private sector buyers, as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although the\\nU.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in the\\nevent that the Chinese reduce their demand, the increase in interest rates would likely be small.\\nMajor consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on the\\nreason behind the decision. It would be in China\\'s best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if China\\nreduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greater\\nflexibility in the currency\\'s movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance its\\neconomy and be able to sustain rapid growth.\\nChina is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America\\'s banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China to\\nfinance its budget deficits.\\nIf instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate, it will build up large additional amounts of official\\nreserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities, then China will increase its\\npurchases of assets denominated in other currencies, with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.\\nIn these circumstances, China would continue to intervene in its exchange market, with the central bank buying U.S.\\ndollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be an\\nappreciation of the euro. Consequently, countries in Europe, not the United States, would probably be most affected by\\nChina\\'s move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweigh\\nthe effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.\\nAlternatively, China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of other\\nmajor currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interest\\nrates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, the U.S.\\nFederal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent market\\ndisruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur a\\nsubstantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss, and are\\nvery unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact, the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternative\\nofficial reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.\\nMyth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goods\\nThis is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover, all of the basic types of\\nmanufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances,\\netc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitute\\nfor products from China would be higher, but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition among\\nproducers has become fiercer, and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers are\\nnarrowing.\\nDependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth in\\nChina is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009\\nowing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions, the country will struggle to meet this\\nobjective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.\\nMyth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.\\nThe Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure, they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.\\nThe Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. While\\nno country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure, the truth is that, if there is no pressure, there\\nis less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are wedded to the status quo\\nbecause of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments in\\nChina\\'s exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008, China has reverted to\\nfixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.\\nWithout a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China\\'s policies are likely to\\nbe delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.\\nMyth No. 4: Instability is bad for China\\nChinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effects\\non China\\'s growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changes\\nin China. For example, concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has been\\na major factor behind new initiatives to develop China\\'s interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improve\\nconditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment of\\nmigrant workers). Hence, for China, instability is not necessarily bad, but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability in\\nChina also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China\\'s growth. Although China\\naccounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth, the country does not generate much demand for products from\\nother countries given China\\'s large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodity\\nproducers may be benefiting from China\\'s strong growth, but overall, it is not providing much stimulus for the world\\neconomy as a whole, so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.\\nIt is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chinese\\nauthorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing the\\nChinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China\\'s economy, but this should be done in his private discussions\\nwith China\\'s senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, such as those in the context of the G-20 process, are a much more\\neffective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China\\'s economic policies jointly with other major\\neconomies.\\nWithout a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China\\'s policies are likely to\\nbe delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the best\\ninterest of China, because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth toward\\ngreater reliance on consumption, China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting China\\nto fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the United\\nStates and other major economies.CorningJake, capricia, philippe and I going to\\nLeft u note upstairs.\\nCdm wants u to call.\\nLeaving eikenberry memo for u.FYII will be traveling next week so I will not be in the office.\\nIf there are time-sensitive matters that I can address this week rather than next week, please let me know.\\nBest.\\ncdmYes, will call now.B1\\n1.4(D)\\nSee below.Thanks, Hillary.

Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack\\nObama, \"You lie!\" during the president\\'s nationally televised speech on healthcare,\\nthe fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the conservative\\ngrassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson\\'s histrionics came\\nfrom the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a\\nhref=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-joe-wilson-member-\\nneo>belonged to</a> for several years.\\n\"Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire\\nto be polite,\" the SCV Tea Party <a\\nhref=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. \"It is the liar who\\nmust apologize, not the one who identifies the liar!\"\\nWho are the SCV?

Do we need to kill it to save it?\\nBY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009\\nDiscussion over the fate of Foggy Bottom usually focuses on the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the troubles\\nof public diplomacy, and the rise of special envoys on everything from European pipelines to Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\nBut Americans would benefit more from a reassessment of the core functionality of the U.S. State Department.\\nYears of neglect and marginalization, as well as a dearth of long-term vision and strategic planning, have left the 19th-\\ncentury institution hamstrung with fiefdoms and bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon now funds and controls a wide\\nrange of foreign-policy and diplomatic priorities -- from development to public diplomacy and beyond. The world has\\nchanged, with everyone from politicians to talking heads to terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The most\\npressing issues are stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, and conflict. But as report after\\nreport, investigation after investigation, has highlighted, the State Department is broken and paralyzed, unable to\\nrespond to the new 21st-century paradigm.\\nBut how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great Humpty Dumpty and\\nreassign the pieces?\\nThere is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its \"core missions\" of\\ntraditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Accountability Office (gao) found\\nthat the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (a\\nbureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities,\\nthe failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including\\n\"today\\'s threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria,\" the gao\\'s report said -- and coordination with bodies like the\\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\\nAnother report by the State Department\\'s inspector general this year described severe and broad dysfunction within the\\nAfrica bureau, while ignoring -- perhaps considering it a given -- the lack of departmentwide integration and leadership\\nin operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computers\\ncapable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command.\\nBy necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies on\\nPentagon funding and even personnel for basic operations central to its mission. For example, the Defense Department\\nnow performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, for\\nexample, the State Department\\'s budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagon\\'s is $600,000. And, in the State\\nDepartment\\'s bureaucratic wisdom, the $30,000 does not even belong to its undersecretary for public diplomacy and\\npublic affairs.\\nFurther, rivalries between the different \"cones\" -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the \"conal caste system\"\\n-- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureau\\nnoted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a \"failed office\" -- and that the situation is worse in 2009.\\nPublic outreach workers said the bureau\\'s leadership \"does not understand public diplomacy.\" The sentiment is\\nwidespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy,\\ndescribed a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professional\\ndiscrimination against those in the career track.\\nAttempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in human\\nand financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering its\\nbottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike\\nMullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation is\\nso dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. If\\nthere were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would mean\\nit would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors.\\nThe creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to such\\nluminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the \"expanding\\nrole of the military in U.S. foreign policy.\" He said he was concerned by the \"migration of functions and authorities from\\nU.S. civilian agencies to the Department of Defense.\"\\nSome commentators have even wondered aloud whether the best way to fix the State Department might be to destroy\\nit. Foggy Bottom could retain a small core staff for its embassies and ambassadors. All other functions -- such as public\\ndiplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing --\\ncould migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies.\\nBut atomizing the State Department would ultimately prove dangerous and further the militarization of foreign policy.\\nThe Pentagon needs a counterbalance, a vertically integrated State Department that the president, Congress, and the\\nU.S. public can count on. Change, rather than creative destruction, is what Foggy Bottom needs.\\nEnvision a State Department capable of leading whole-of-government initiatives with a strategic focus instead of one\\nhidebound department geared by structure and tradition to execute state-to-state diplomacy. This \"Department of State\\nand Non-State\" would be as deft at tackling stateless terrorist networks and hurricanes as it would be at fostering and\\nupholding alliances with foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom in this way will require breaking the rigid\\nhierarchy, stovepipes, and bottlenecks which make the Pentagon look lean and dynamic in comparison.\\nModern global affairs are not compartmentalized by political borders. Besides expanding the overly shallow and narrow\\nauthorities of the public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure the State Department to focus less on countries\\nand more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottom\\'s regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured to\\noversee its patch of embassies. Country desk officers, and most ambassadors, report to an assistant secretary, the\\nregional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton.\\nClinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This would\\nhelp eliminate an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and would also align the State Department with the Defense\\nDepartment (which has powerful regional commands, such as Centcom and Africom). The State Department\\'s regional\\nleaders would hold an equivalent civilian rank to four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These\\nchanges would promise to improve communications, synchronize missions, and put the department on the right path for\\ntoday\\'s requirements.\\nBut Clinton should beware reforming the State Department too quickly from within -- her efforts could be paralyzed by a\\nbureaucracy in mutiny that would simply wait her out. U.S. national security would suffer and the Pentagon\\'s growing\\npower would become more entrenched. Clinton will need the clear and unequivocal support of the president and more\\nimportantly Congress, which authorizes State Department spending bills, to have a chance at success.\\nIn a burst of activity after Barack Obama\\'s election, Congress authorized more money and people for the\\nState Department and pushed for greater public diplomacy. Still more is required. The question asked over the last eight\\nyears as the State Department abrogated its various responsibilities -- if not Defense, then who? -- will not, indeed\\ncannot, be answered until the department steps up to the plate and becomes effective and visible in leading and\\nimplementing U.S. foreign policy. This will take time. But, as the saying goes, there is no time like the present. The\\nUnited States now has a Congress that supports change, secretaries of state and defense who want change, a president\\nwhose entire election platform was built around the word \"change,\" and an American public that would be outraged at\\nthe dysfunction if it only knew the details.\\n3###Cherie Blair\\nMonday, September 14, 2009 12:02 PM\\nH; hr15@mycingular.blackberry.net\\npsolisdoylE\\nSheikha Mosa of Qatar\\nShe is available to see you on 24th September either morning or afternoon?

BLOW\\nA hundred and fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened \"A Tale of Two Cities\" with the now-famous phrase:\\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ...\"\\nThose words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks in\\nAmerica. So far, it\\'s been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas — one of the ascension of the first\\nblack president with the cultural capital that accrues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racial\\ntensions, while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain, let alone commiserate in it.\\nLast year, blacks dared to dream anew, envisioning a future in which Obama\\'s election would be the catalyst for\\nan era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the election\\'s afterglow has nearly faded, the hysteria of\\nhope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways, they\\'ve\\ngotten worse.\\nThe recession, for one, has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks.\\nA May report from the Pew Research Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-priced\\nsubprime loans, leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks have displaced Hispanics as the group with\\nthe lowest homeownership rates.\\nAccording to the most recent jobs data, not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whites,\\nthe gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate\\nover that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohorts,\\nthe rate grew by about twice that much.\\nAnd a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008, \"food insecurity\" for\\nAmerican households had risen to record levels, with black children being the most likely to experience that\\nfood insecurity.\\nThings on the racial front are just as bad.\\nWe are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protester\\nwith a racist poster can hijack a news cycle, while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact, racially\\noffensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the results\\nof image searches of them.\\nAnd it\\'s not all words and images; it\\'s actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\\'s 2008\\nhate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007, while the combined hate\\ncrimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend, which would\\ninclude Obarna\\'s ascension as a candidate, anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent, while those against the\\nother racial groups have fallen 19 percent.\\nThis has had a sobering effect on blacks. According to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup, last summer 23 percent of\\nblacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half that\\npercentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better.\\nThe racial animosity that Obama\\'s election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect among\\nblacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24, Obama\\'s approval rating among whites has dropped\\nto 39 percent, but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.\\nAlso, this hasn\\'t exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up for\\naccidentally shooting off a gun in a club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off his\\nmouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat\\nRihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently, the \"personal failings\" of\\nTiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile, the most critically acclaimed black movie of the year,\\n\"Precious,\" features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the president\\nfeels like a nice counterbalance.\\nHowever, the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama\\'s\\nenemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when their\\nvoices would have presumably held greater sway.\\nThis means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important to\\nAfrican-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he\\'s losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. In\\nthe Nov. 9 Gallup poll, the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting efforts\\nto aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.\\nThe hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.\\nAccording to my analysis, even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day, Obama\\nwould still be president. To a large degree, Obama was elected by white people, some of whom were more able\\nto accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.\\nIn fact, commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.\\nIn a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this month,\\nresearchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his \"true\\nessence.\" In some of the photos, his skin had been lightened. In others, it had been darkened. The result? The\\nmore people identified him with the \"whiter\" images, the more likely they were to have voted for him, and vice\\nversa.\\nThe Age of Obama, so far at least, seems less about Obama as a black community game-changer than as a\\nWhite House gamesman. It\\'s unclear if there will be a positive Obama Effect, but an Obama Backlash is\\nincreasingly apparent. Meanwhile, black people are also living a tale of two actions: grin and bear it.\\nForwarded messageYes! ForthcomingFyiThank you for your message.

Sidsbwhoeop\\nFriday, January 1, 2010 12:27 PM\\nRe: Happy New Year!\\nAnd read Krugman today in nytGot it. It\\'s on my list to track down today.Great - let\\'s do 730 your time.\\nXOKrugman, in case you haven\\'t seen:\\nJanuary 1, 2010\\nOp-Ed Columnist\\nChinese New Year\\nBy PAUL KRUGMAN\\nIt\\'s the season when pundits traditionally make predictions about the year ahead. Mine concerns international economics:\\nI predict that 2010 will be the year of China. And not in a good way.\\nActually, the biggest problems with China involve climate change. But today I want to focus on currency policy.\\nChina has become a major financial and trade power. But it doesn\\'t act like other big economies. Instead, it follows a\\nmercantilist policy, keeping its trade surplus artificially high. And in today\\'s depressed world, that policy is, to put it bluntly,\\npredatory.\\nHere\\'s how it works: Unlike the dollar, the euro or the yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China\\'s currency is pegged by\\nofficial policy at about 6.8 yuan to the dollar. At this exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantage\\nover its rivals, leading to huge trade surpluses.\\nUnder normal circumstances, the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China\\'s currency,\\nunless it was offset by private investors heading the other way. And private investors are trying to get into China, not out\\nof it. But China\\'s government restricts capital inflows, even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad, adding to a $2\\ntrillion-plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves.\\nThis policy is good for China\\'s export-oriented state-industrial complex, not so good for Chinese consumers. But what\\nabout the rest of us?\\nIn the past, China\\'s accumulation of foreign reserves, many of which were invested in American bonds, was arguably\\ndoing us a favor by keeping interest rates low — although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate a\\nhousing bubble. But right now the world is awash in cheap money, looking for someplace to go. Short-term interest rates\\nare close to zero; long-term interest rates are higher, but only because investors expect the zero-rate policy to end some\\nday. China\\'s bond purchases make little or no difference.\\nMeanwhile, that trade surplus drains much-needed demand away from a depressed world economy. My back-of-the-\\nenvelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U.S.\\nemployment by around 1.4 million jobs.\\nThe Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints:\\n\"On one hand, you are asking for the yuan to appreciate, and on the other hand, you are taking all kinds of protectionist\\nmeasures.\" Indeed: other countries are taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let its\\ncurrency rise. And more such measures are entirely appropriate.\\nOr are they? I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies. Neither holds water.\\nFirst, there\\'s the claim that we can\\'t confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U.S. economy by\\ndumping their hoard of dollars. This is all wrong, and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses on\\nthemselves. The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also mean\\nthat China has little or no financial leverage.\\nAgain, right now the world is awash in cheap money. So if China were to start selling dollars, there\\'s no reason to think it\\nwould significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies — but that would\\nbe good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them a\\nthank-you note.Is at 7pm in the Jockey Club of the Fairfax Hotel\\n2100 Massachusetts Avenue NorthwestJack is having 7pm dinner at fairfax hotel with eikenberry and petreaus which is right down the street from u on mass\\navenue.

Women already make up the majority of\\nuniversity graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional\\nworkers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run many\\nof the world\\'s great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France.\\nWomen\\'s economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our\\ntimes. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menial\\njobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to\\nabandon their careers when they married and had children. Today they are\\nrunning some of the organisations that once treated them as second-class\\ncitizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives.\\nAnd millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try to\\nresist this trend—most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and some\\nsouthern European countries—will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent\\nand frustrated citizens.\\nThis revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article).\\nMen have, by and large, welcomed women\\'s invasion of the workplace. Yet even\\nthe most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particular\\nadvance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under-\\nrepresented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America\\'s largest\\ncompanies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paid\\nsignificantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work and\\nchild-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they have\\ntoo little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children—\\nparticularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of\\nfemale participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money\\non child care.\\nDealing with the juggle\\nThese two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choose\\nbetween their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressure\\ncompanies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then\\nfind it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled women\\nare trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements.\\nMotherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost as\\nmuch as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers\\' relative\\npoverty also disadvantages their children.\\nDemand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even if\\nsome of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superior\\nworkers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex,\\nincluding the \"war for talent\" and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Law\\nfirms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their \"up or out\" promotion systems\\nbecause they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies in\\nGermany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making it\\neasier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways.\\nWomen have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In the\\nEuropean Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. In\\nAmerica three out of four people thrown out of work since the \"mancession\"\\nbegan have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by\\n2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America.\\nThe light hand of the state\\nAll this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stopped\\ncalls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has used\\nthreats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there are\\nwomen. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries.\\nThey have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of\\nthe social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument,\\nthere is a way to speed up the revolution—and improve the tough lives of many\\nworking women and their children?\\nIf that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-action\\nprogrammes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer is\\nno. To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and\\nunfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthy\\nperiods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helps\\nexplain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a\\nlower proportion of women in management than America does.\\nBut there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make life\\neasier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at\\nhome. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance,\\nclose at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer.\\nThese things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter\\nschools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, without\\ngoing to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: it\\nspends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other rich\\ncountry, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid\\nmaternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric\\nabout \"real family values\".\\nStill, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that\\nwomen have made in recent decades. During the second world war, when\\nAmerica\\'s menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up the\\nimage of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and \"We Can Do It\" slogan, to\\nencourage women into the workforce. Today women are marching into the\\nworkplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining\\nglass ceilings.sbwhoeop\\nSunday, January 3, 2010 10:01 AM\\nH: They asked for 250 words and I wrote slightly more, briefly on China.

In pursuit of its narrow and even\\ncrude understanding of its interest, China will constantly abuse and break international rules, protocols and bodies. Its\\nwillful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in a\\nbeggar-thy-neighbour approach, environmental degradation, and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generally\\nare the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism, in Africa especially but also\\nelsewhere, China is able to gain help, partly through economic intimidation, in its international forays to repel or strike\\ndown the responsibilities of internationalism.\\nInternally, China is a prison of nations, an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, and may also be the\\nmost unequal industrial country in distribution of income. China\\'s power is increasing, but the authoritarian regime is\\nhardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers or\\nex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable, which accounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear of\\noperating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard, of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with real\\nchoice, and ultimately of letting go even a little bit).\\nIn the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes of\\nentrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. China\\'s growing economic power is accompanied by expanding\\narrogance, demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there.\\nChina\\'s regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity, itself based incoherently on reckless\\neconomic development, for example in the areas of currency, environment and labour; it has no \"soft power\", not just\\nbecause of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy, but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forces\\nits way through coercion of one sort or another.\\nThe next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at a\\nrhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase \"strategic reassurance\" was risible\\nand did not last. For now, the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency.\\nThe most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vatican\\nto the Taliban - arrayed against modernity, the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States may\\neven have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutional\\namendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the first\\nfemale one will not be so great.\\nSidney Blumenthal is former senior adviser to President Clinton, and an Oscar and Emmy award-winning documentary\\nproducer.

We are seeing if there are other options and will get back to youI. Introduction\\nThe next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department\\'s leadership in\\nbridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts,\\ndefining the mission and role of the Office of the Special Representative for Global\\nIntergovernmental Affairs (\"S/SRGIA\"), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the\\nDepartment and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working in\\ncollaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the\\nSecretary\\'s and Administration\\'s priorities.\\nII. Key Objectives\\nThe Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the global\\nneeds of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA will\\nalso connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world,\\npromote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, and\\nfacilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with\\nDepartment priorities.\\nIII. Next Steps\\nThis work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow and\\nimplement in the next six months. To place the Work Plan in context, we describe below\\nS/SRGIA\\' s work-planning process.\\nA. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department.\\nCurrently, no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the\\nneeds of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected leaders, the entities\\nthat represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials\\'\\nconcerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting ,\\nthe priority of the person in the bureau\\'s estimation or the nature of the request. Priority\\nactivities will be as follows:\\n1\\nSensitive But Unclassified\\n• Confirm the Secretary\\'s support to focus on priority issues and countries;\\n• Join Department\\'s meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and local\\nrepresentatives and dignitaries to establish S/SRGIA\\'s role;\\n• Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the State\\nDepartment, by explaining the value of these stakeholders;\\n• Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage the\\nState Department\\'s collective U.S. and global intergovernmental relationships;\\n• Follow and interpret international issues (e.g., food security, global health, climate\\nchange, trade and economic development, energy) of importance to state governments;\\n• Promote dialogue between the Department (e.g., USAID, EEB, ECA, Public Private\\nPartnerships, Global Women\\'s Issues, Consular Affairs, MCC and targeted Regional\\nBureaus) and external constituents (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected officials, and\\nthe entities that they represent) for more effective partnerships and relationships; and\\n• Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreign\\nintergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U.S.\\nintergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further their\\nglobal goals.\\nB. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of\\nU.S. intergovernmental officials.\\nState economies are increasingly globalized, and more and more U.S. companies are\\ncompeting in international markets and against firms worldwide. As the principal stewards of\\ntheir states\\' economic success, Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents both\\nchallenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continued\\ncompetitiveness. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach\\nactivities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and international\\norganizations. U.S. national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but are\\nnot limited to the following:\\n• National Governors Association;\\n• National Lt. Governors Association;\\n• U.S. Conference of Mayors;\\n• National League of Cities;\\n• National Association of Counties/Large Urban County Caucus;\\n• National Association of States Attorney Generals;\\n• National State Legislatures; and\\n• Councils of State Governments.\\nOutreach is essential to many aspects of the Department\\'s activities. S/SRGIA\\'s outreach\\nobjective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the State\\nDepartment efforts in global intergovernmental affairs, especially among decision makers and\\npolicy makers, educational entities, non-governmental organizations, public-interest groups and\\npublic agencies. S/SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local elected\\nofficials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U.S.\\nterritories. Specific objectives are to:\\n2\\nSensitive But Unclassified\\n• Build state by state profiles, thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunities\\nfor collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Department\\npriorities;\\n• Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships with\\nprincipals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs;\\n• Create dialogue with the Governors and Mayors in preparation for the NGA and Mayors\\nWashington conferences in the fall;\\n• Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroad\\nrequired to implement the Department\\'s global intergovernmental affairs agenda;\\n• Develop a network of leaders, to collaborate and create partnerships;\\n• Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials;\\n• Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad;\\n• Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum of\\nUnderstandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsible\\nparties; and\\n• Collaboration with EEB, to partner with them to engage state and local government\\nleaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts (e.g. the Administration\\'s\\nNational Export Initiative and EEB/Consular Affairs Business Visa Facilitation initiative,\\netc.).\\nC. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of\\nmiddle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials.\\nCurrently, ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign and\\ndomestic government officials. None of ECA\\'s programs target regions with the\\nobjective of enhancing another country\\'s government systems because the bureau\\'s\\nauthorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under the\\nauspices of enhancing mutual understanding. The most visible ECA program is the\\nInternational Visitor Leadership Program which in FY09 brought in 1,390 foreign\\ngovernment officials at the state, city and national levels to gain knowledge around the\\nUS political system and culture. To date, the bureau estimates the same number of\\ngovernment visitors in FY10.\\nThus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in\\npartnership with international organizations. International organizations who serve local\\ngovernmental authorities include but are not limited to the following:\\n• United Cities and Local Governments;\\n• Metropolis;\\n• The World Urban Forum;\\n• UN-HABITAT;\\n• Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of Housing and Urbanization;\\n• UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities;\\n• The World Mayors Council on Climate Change;\\n3\\nSensitive But Unclassified\\n• Sister Cities International;\\n• Local Governments for Sustainability; and\\n• Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa.\\nPriority activities will be as follows:\\n• S/SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreach\\nwith strategic countries — e.g. Af, Pak, Iraq — and key emerging powers (Brazil,\\nIndia, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria) and developing countries (Rwanda,\\nEthiopia, Kenya, etc.) to obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle\\nand senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials;\\n• Collaborate with [NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of what\\nforeign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their US\\ncounterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns,\\nopportunities, programs and connections.\\nD. Provide Leadership for Department Intergovernmental Capacity Building.\\nOne of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in the\\ngovernment below the President and Prime Minister level. As the Department seeks to\\nimplement development programs or conduct diplomacy, there is often limited local counterpart\\ncapacity to do so with or to empower. S/SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus and\\noffices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity of\\nintergovernmental officials in countries around the world. Currently, millions of dollars of\\nUSAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractors\\nand have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact. S/SRGIA will partner with\\nexisting offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space, accountability for the\\noutcomes and programming, and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here in\\nthe US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed.\\nS/SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derived\\nfrom studying successful and less-successful approaches. Within the next six months, S/SRGIA\\nwill work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources. Priority activities\\nwill be as follows:\\n• Identify State Department investments, canvass additional State Department dedicated\\nresources other than grant-making and assess the strength of the current environment\\nneeded to advance the S/SRGIA\\'s Secretary capacity building agenda for state and local\\nleaders; participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda;\\n• Develop an agenda for a high-level retreat on the formulation of a National Capacity\\nDevelopment Strategy to present achievements to date, lessons learned and proposals for\\ninstitutional capacity development going forward;\\n• Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacity\\nbuilding is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development efforts;\\n4\\nSensitive But Unclassified\\n• Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacity\\ndevelopment by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public-private\\npartnerships;\\n• Prioritize discrete initiatives to \"fast track\", based on importance, regional priorities (e.g.,\\nAsia, Africa and Latin America), assessment of readiness, impact and feasibility and\\ntranslate priorities into actionable interventions;\\n• Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity-building initiatives related to\\nglobal intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships;\\n• Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIA\\ncapacity building initiative; and\\n• Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on their\\nprojects and Department priorities.\\nIV. Administrative Activities\\n• Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy, business, trade,\\nconsular affairs, etc.; and\\n• Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development office\\nwebsites.\\nV. Budget and Staffing\\nS/SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission.\\nVI. Assessment of Progress\\nThe short term goal will be to engage U.S. intergovernmental officials about their global\\nconcerns. The S/SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high-level State\\nDepartment engagement for U.S. state and local elected officials. The benefits of this new office\\nwill be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens. Assisting US states and local\\ngovernments to expand their exports, promote locations for foreign investment and for\\nparticipation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope to\\nachieve with respect to U.S. intergovernmental officials.\\nWith respect to the global intergovernmental officials, in the short term, we expect to\\nwork with our Regional Bureaus and Offices, (e.g., USAID, ECA, EEB, etc.) to assess the\\ncurrent state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to this\\nconstituency.\\nIn the longer term, institutionally, we need to sustain relationships with our embassies\\nand missions overseas, so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies to\\nexpand their global business base. As related to our national capacity building strategy, in the\\nlong term, we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officials\\nabroad. We also seek accountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provide\\nleadership for future investments. Going forward, we will tailor these investments to address\\nregional State Department priorities.\\n5\\nSensitive But Unclassified\\nIn addition, since there is a lack of USG harmonization of all of the relevant USG\\nprograms, having S/SRGIA be the designated coordinator will allow DOS to take the lead in\\nsynchronizing government wide programs that engage foreign government officials. This will be\\nanother long term goal for the office.\\nVII. Potential Events\\nA. Potential Events and Activities for S\\n1. Private Dinner or Luncheon with the Governors and Urban Mayors;\\n2. Roundtable or Speech at USCMNGA Winter Meetings; and\\n3. Recommendations of Governors and Mayors for S to extend possible invitations for\\noccasional international travel with S.\\nB.

Thanks pal.Readouts from all your calls r going to the relevant people.Per the plan, a statement is being released in your name. This is the same statement you saw in the memo package\\nfrom Mitchell:\\nToday\\'s announcement by the Government of Israel helps move forward toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian\\nconflict. We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the\\nconflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed\\nswaps, and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments\\nand meet Israeli security requirements. Let me say to all the people of the region and world: our commitment to\\nachieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering.I just talked to the French NEA equivalent.\\nJeffrey FeltmanMadam Secretary: We are in total agreement with the French on this issue, are coordinating closely and being proactive\\nin our own diplomacy.\\nJohnnieI\\'ve asked Todd to identify the specific areas where he thinks progress can be made through discussions on Thursday.\\nAt a high level, I think leaders\\' conversations on Thursday will begin to narrow gaps on the big issues -- transparency,\\nfunding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and it\\'s a big if) those gaps are narrow-able. If they\\'re not, then\\nThursday/Friday will be days of trying and failing ... but at least trying.\\nTodd\\'s view is that there is not enough time Friday for top-level meetings to close the deal; that two days are required.\\nYou would be our head of delegation for the first, POTUS for the second.Will get back to you on the specific process, but my understanding is that it will be a series of bilats and possibly some\\nworking sessions. You can meet with leaders; harder for Todd or Chu to do so.Netanyahu gave a press conference a few hours ago. I\\'ve seen plenty of his quotes in stories. Let me see if I can find\\ntranscript.Will do.Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM\\'s name:\\nToday, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits\\nand new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.\\nMy cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.\\nWe hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will\\nfinally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.\\nWe are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.\\nWe have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab\\nworld would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.\\nWell, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.\\nI hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and\\na new future for our children and for their children.\\nSince the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the\\nPalestinians.\\nDuring that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate\\nin which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.\\nWe have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge\\nand removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.\\nThese actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security\\nenvironment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.\\nNow we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.\\nI have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing\\nsettlements.\\nI said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that\\'s exactly what we decided to do today.\\nI promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters,\\nwho live in Judea and Samaria.\\nThat is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway.\\nIt will not include the schools, kindergartens, synagogues and public buildings necessary for the continuation of normal\\nlife over the time period of the suspension.\\nObviously, any infrastructure that may be needed to protect our national security or to safeguard the lives of our citizens\\nwill also be provided during this time.\\nRegarding Jerusalem, our sovereign capital, our position is well known. We do not put any restrictions on building in our\\nsovereign capital.\\nAs always, we are committed to protect freedom of worship for all faiths and to ensure equal and fair treatment for all\\nthe city\\'s residents, Jews and Arabs alike.\\nWhen the suspension ends, my government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to\\nconstruction.\\nI want to say clearly to the Palestinians: Now is the time to begin negotiations. Now is the time to move the peace\\nprocess forward. There is no more time to waste.\\nIsrael has taken a far reaching step for peace. It\\'s time for the Palestinians to do the same.Daniel R is going to get it to him, along with your statement, highlighting what you\\'ve said about 1967.I am meeting with Raj but should be done by llam - can you talk then?List we are reaching out to:\\nSaudi\\nItaly\\nPoland\\nRomania\\nSpain\\nFrance\\nNetherlands\\nAustralia\\nCanada\\nNorway\\nDenmark\\nSweden\\nJapan\\nSouth KoreaI think Jake should be on the call.\\nOnce the call is scheduled, I will get a version to you before the call that reflects the latest revisions I\\'ve\\nreceived.\\nDan\\nOn Sun, Dec 13, 2009 at 7:56 AM, H <HDR22@clintonemai1.com> wrote:\\nThe latest draft is getting closer.

Obama, in contrast, had a 51 percent\\napproval and a 45 percent disapproval rating.\\nThe Secretary of State has conducted several well-received foreign trips in recent months and has\\nnot been as closely identified with the more contentious elements of the Administration\\'s agenda,\\nincluding the health care fight, the federal deficit and the Wall Street bailouts.

The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue.\\nU.S. President Barack Obama has called for an \"operational accord\" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that\\ncan get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is\\nhammered out in 2010.\\nSome ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure.\\n\"We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we\\'ll fail on the substance, but at least let\\'s give it a try,\"\\nsaid Britain\\'s energy and climate minister Ed Miliband.\\n\"At the moment the problem is we\\'re not giving it a try.\"\\nDeveloped and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how\\nmuch funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world.\\nWhile the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal.\\nAfrica dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion\\n(6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions.\\nTalks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States\\npledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests.\\nA major sticking point between the world\\'s top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of how\\nthey will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans.\\nOn Tuesday, China\\'s climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse\\nto set up trade barriers.

It\\'s really about the tragedy of brothers wrongfully detained at\\nGuantanamo but it makes clear that Palau is doing the U.S. a great service and has been more courageous in this regard than most of\\nthe world (although Palau is in many ways more vulnerable to China): The Secretary complimenting Pres. Toribiong re this was a good\\nmove right after Alcy upset the Palauans (as you feared) in a meeting I will give you a confidential report on separately. Jeff\\n2 Brothers\\' Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo\\nTo Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning Family\\nBy Del Quentin Wilber\\nWashington Post Staff Writer\\nMonday, September 28, 2009\\nBahtiyar Mahnut, a detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, learned a few weeks ago that the\\nPacific island nation of Palau had invited him to settle there.\\nIt should have been cause for celebration, especially for a man who desperately wants to be free. But, to the\\nsurprise of his attorneys, Bahtiyar has turned down the offer. He wishes to remain a prisoner, they say, so he can\\nlook after his older brother, a fellow detainee.\\nThe brothers\\' saga, as related by their attorneys and military records, could transpire only in the context of\\nGuantanamo Bay and comes at a critical juncture for the Obama administration, which is struggling to meet a\\nJan. 22 deadline to shutter the 223-detainee prison. Their circumstances also highlight the diplomatic difficulties\\nfacing the U.S. government as it tries to find places to send prisoners not destined for terrorism trials in the\\nUnited States.\\nThe brothers are Uighurs, residents of China who are considered separatists by Beijing but are not enemies of\\nthe United States. The brothers were picked up separately in Afghanistan and Pakistan soon after the United\\nStates launched attacks against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in retaliation for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\\nSince at least 2003, the U.S. government has tried to find homes for the brothers and 20 other captured Uighurs.\\nFive went to Albania in 2006; four were sent to Bermuda in June. At one point, U.S. officials were considering\\nthe possibility of resettling Uighurs in the D.C. region, but that plan was scuttled under political pressure. Most\\ncountries have been reluctant to accept Uighurs and risk angering China.\\nIn recent weeks, however, Palau has agreed to accept 12 of the 13 remaining Uighurs, according to the Justice\\nDepartment.\\nThe only detainee not invited by Palau was Bahtiyar\\'s older brother, Arkin Mahmud, 45, who has developed\\nmental health problems that are apparently too serious to be treated in the sparsely populated country, said his\\nattorney, Elizabeth Gilson.\\nTo make matters worse, according to Gilson and military records, Arkin is a prisoner only because he went\\nsearching for Bahtiyar after the younger brother left their homeland eight years ago.\\n\"This is just very difficult and sad,\" said Abubakkir Qasim, 40, a Uighur freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2006\\nwho considers himself a friend of both brothers.\\n\"Bahtiyar is turning away freedom for his brother,\" Qasim said through an interpreter. \"His brother is only there\\nbecause of Bahtiyar. I feel sorry for both of them.\"\\nFive other Uighurs have declined the offer for a variety of reasons, according to one of their attorneys, Susan\\nBaker Manning. The Justice Department says the government thinks that six to eight Uighurs will go to Palau.\\nThe earliest they could leave would be Thursday, the Justice Department says.\\nOfficials at the Defense and State departments and the Palau Embassy in Washington either declined to\\ncomment or did not return phone messages.\\nIn 2001, Bahtiyar and Arkin, both Muslims, were living with their parents and a younger brother in a small\\nhouse in bustling Ghulja in Western China. Arkin is the father of two children, then 8 and 5. The brothers were\\nnot particularly devout but felt oppressed by the government of Beijing, which does not allow worship and\\nensures the best jobs go to ethnic Chinese. The brothers were forced to survive as menial tradesmen. Bahtiyar\\nsold clothes; Arkin repaired shoes.\\nBahtiyar wanted to strike out on his own. So, with $700 in his pocket, he headed for Pakistan. But he quickly\\nran out of money and couldn\\'t find work. He was worried about being sent back to China until a friend told him\\nabout a group of Uighurs in Afghanistan that wanted \"to fight against the Chinese government.\"\\n\"If I went,\" he told military officials, \"I didn\\'t have to pay for food or anything. So I went to Afghanistan.\"\\nThere, he lived with 35 other Uighurs in a camp of dusty roads and shacks in the southern mountains. The group\\nbuilt houses and a mosque. They trained with one automatic rifle and did some push-ups, pull-ups and other\\ncalisthenics, records show.\\nWithin a few weeks of arriving at the camp, Bahtiyar managed to call home. His mother was very worried and\\ntold Arkin to find his brother. \"He left because he was a dutiful son,\" Gilson said.\\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. military began bombing Afghanistan and destroyed Bahtiyar\\'s camp,\\nsending the Uighurs into the mountains for shelter. Bahtiyar and others crossed into neighboring Pakistan,\\nwhere they were arrested and turned over to U.S. authorities.\\nMeanwhile, Arkin made his way to Afghanistan, where he was captured by the Northern Alliance and turned\\nover the United States. At a military prison in Kandahar, the brothers saw each other across the razor wire.\\nIn 2002, the military brought the brothers and 20 other Uighurs to Guantanamo Bay. Authorities alleged at the\\ntime that the men trained at military-style camps affiliated with the Taliban or al-Qaeda. The accusations later\\ndissolved upon close scrutiny by the courts.\\nArkin and Bahtiyar were confined in separate cells and, for months, were not able to talk. A Uighur interpreter\\nworking for the military, Rushan Abbas, persuaded the military in 2003 to allow the brothers to meet in an\\ninterrogation room.\\nWhen they saw each other, they hugged and wept. \"It was just so emotional,\" Abbas said. \"These brothers from\\nacross the world coming together in an interrogation room for the first time.\"\\nIn 2005, Arkin remained in solitary confinement. He had a record of disciplinary infractions and had been\\ndisrespectful to the guards, records show.\\nNot for the first time, Bahtiyar took steps to help his brother. Living in a more relaxed part of the prison, he was\\ngranted a request to be moved to Arkin\\'s camp. \"I missed my brother so much,\" he told military officials.\\nBy the next year, the brothers had been cleared for release by the military. The government did not present any\\nevidence to justify their detention in a federal lawsuit brought the Uighurs seeking their freedom. In October, a\\njudge ordered them freed into the United States, but that decision was overturned on appeal. The Uighurs are\\nawaiting word, expected this week, on whether the Supreme Court will hear the case.\\nLast year, the remaining Uighurs were moved to a fenced-in camp that includes an activities room, video games\\nand books. Through it all, Arkin and Bahtiyar have struggled to cope with being prisoners, perhaps for years to\\ncome. \"I know I\\'ll die in here,\" Arkin told Gilson not long ago. \"In China, at least I would have a trial and\\nsentence.\"\\nSince taking their case in 2005, Gilson has met with Arkin dozens of times. But she had only spoken to Bahtiyar\\nby phone. He had refused to meet with her, frustrated by lawyers always talking about what he considered\\nfruitless legal victories.\\nTwo weeks ago, he changed his mind. Bahtiyar felt that he owed her an explanation for refusing Palau\\'s\\ngenerous offer. \"Every day here is an eternity,\" he told Gilson through an interpreter. \"But I have to look out for\\nmy brother.\"\\nJeffrey L.

We\\'ll have a copy for you as well.\\nAfghan speech below\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\nSeptember 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin\\'s Office\\nPhone: 202.224.6221\\nSenate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army\\nRemarks as prepared for delivery\\nToday we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists\\nmotivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent\\nlives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those\\nterrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate\\noccasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.\\nI recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted\\nKaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure\\nthat Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al\\nQaeda to terrorize us and the world.\\nThe Obama administration\\'s new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population\\'s safety and partnering with the\\nAfghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in\\nstrategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal\\'s Counterinsurgency Guidance, to \"live, eat and train\\ntogether [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other\\naccountable....and treat them as equal partners in success.\" The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan\\nsecurity forces \"is our goal.\"\\nTo achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts\\nto become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat\\nforces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan\\nArmy and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than\\npresently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban\\nfighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.\\nWhile the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people\\nhate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly\\nmotivated and its troops are proven fighters.\\nDespite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to\\nregain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the\\nperception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,\\nal Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-\\nlevel Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.\\nI believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that\\nAfghanistan\\'s army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.\\nFirst, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are\\napproximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of\\n2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have\\nurged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of\\nDefense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are\\nprepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and\\nessential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.\\nOur own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand\\nprovince we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in\\nHelmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops \"is absolutely our Achilles heel.\"\\nWhat do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister\\nWardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we\\'ve been assured it is available.\\nBut we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train\\nAfghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would\\nbe necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much\\ngreater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces\\nthey have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.\\nLarger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to\\ngraduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister\\nWardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.\\nMinister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in\\nthe most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group\\nof officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available\\ninfrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.\\nLarger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant\\namount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to\\nequip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create\\nmomentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling\\nit one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world\\'s history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the\\nAfghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that\\nkind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the\\nAfghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.\\nRapidly expanding Afghanistan\\'s military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now\\nface there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in\\ncapabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a\\nyear, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a\\nmajor problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies\\ncan seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a\\nMuslim nation.\\nFinally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of\\nyoung Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the \"Sons of Iraq.\" They were drawn in\\npart by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating\\nhorrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides\\nand became a positive force.\\nThat same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated\\nlargely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They\\nbelieve an effort to attract these fighters to the government\\'s side could succeed, if they are offered security for\\nthemselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.\\nGeneral McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was\\nachieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:\\n\"Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don\\'t see are\\ndeeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander\\'s charismatic\\nleadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call\\nmid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.\"\\nBut this \"game changing\" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal\\'s assessment. There is no plan\\nyet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to\\ninvolve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our\\nAfghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken\\ninto account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.\\nAfghanistan\\'s people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in\\nHelmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or\\nso men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country\\'s future. When asked how long the\\nUnited States should stay, one elder said: \"Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you\\nwill be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests.\"\\nHelping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody\\'s goal. On that there is little difference of\\nopinion, in Afghanistan\\'s village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.\\nCan we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the\\ninitiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency\\nheaded by terrorists whose fanaticism they don\\'t share?\\nI believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more\\nquickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the\\nre-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security\\nforces.\\nOur support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security\\ninterest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.\\nI believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the previously planned and announced increase in\\nU.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by\\na Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on\\nthe United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground\\ncombat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.Bartholomew\\nB6\\nMarshall, Capricia P; Verveer, Melanne S\\nRELEASE IN PART\\nB6Pakistan —total enacted since FY 2002 — FY 2009 is $8 billion (including all function 150 - foreign assistance, state and\\nUSAID ops)\\nAfghanistan — total enacted FY 2001 — FY 2009 is $16.9 billion (same as above)wants to say hello to you.

Tories desperately do not want Blair there, want to run their own\\nEuropean policy, mostly anti-EU, and indeed break with past and continuity on Europe. Tory Party split, with anti-EU\\nfaction dominant, its base virulent, and Cameron straddling as best he can. Hague leans anti-Europe. S\\nLondon Times\\nOctober 22, 2009\\n`Appointing Blair as EU president will have\\nconsequences\\', warns Hague\\nWilliam Hague\\'s strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled\\nFrancis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin\\nWilliam Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair\\nwould be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch\\norganised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations\\nagainst the appointment.\\nEU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week\\'s summit, but the Czech Republic\\'s last-minute\\nobjections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is\\nunderstood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.\\nIn making the Conservatives\\' case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister\\nhad consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats\\nof Mr Blair\\'s actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.\\nA claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair\\'s appointment as a \"declaration of war\"\\nby the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was \"a bit strong\". Nevertheless, it was\\nnot disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and\\nBrussels. Diplomats said that there was a \"clear mark of hostility\".\\n\"Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of\\nTony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy\\ninvolved in the creation of the position in the first place,\" Mr Hague\\'s spokesman said. Mr Hague\\'s strident attack on his\\nfellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.\\nMr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including Hillary Clinton, the\\nSecretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives\\' membership of a right-wing alliance of European\\nparties with allegedly anti-Semitic members.

Please let me know what you think:\\nStatement by the Secretary\\nOn the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009\\nThe United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake\\nof the June 28 coup d\\'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization\\nof American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they\\nagreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national\\nreconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya\"s restitution. These are vital elements of the\\nTegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious\\ndetermination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.\\nThe November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional\\norder in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates\\nrepresenting parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under\\nthe stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral\\nrenewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable\\nexpression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their\\nnew leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.\\nThe holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the\\ndemocratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the\\nregion, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for\\nthe Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique\\nopportunity to promote that vital mission.See traffic below — read downOf course!Photo is gorgeous (and there are 20 more online, some are really great)\\nThe article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn\\'t include a lot of the great stuff he saw that\\nday.

Wouldn\\'t hurt to\\nmention her positively with French interlocutors. See particularly this line: \"There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy\\'s\\nnetwork against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign\\nministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than\\nshe does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much\\ncommuting between Brussels and Britain.\"\\nA blog by the author of our column on the European Union\\nCharlemagne\\'s notebook\\n. Why did Lady Ashton take the EU\\'s foreign policy job?\\n• Jan 26th 2010, 22:04\\nNOT yet February, and the briefing against Catherine Ashton, the newly appointed EU foreign policy chief,\\nis getting nasty. Jean Quatremer, the Brussels blogger and well-connected EU correspondent of Liberation,\\ndropped another depth charge against the baroness tonight. His list of complaints against her is long, and\\nI have a feeling some of them are a smidgeon exaggerated. I find it hard to believe it is literally\\nimpossible to reach Lady Ashton after eight o\\'clock in the evening as Mr Quatremer charges, because she\\nallegedly has her mobile telephones diverted to the EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cell\\nstaffed by officers from national servicies) after that hour. I also have some doubts about the stress laid\\non the fact that she has not yet got round to having top secret security clearance yet, so cannot see any\\nconfidential papers. As a former British cabinet minister, and serving UK commissioner, something tells\\nme the British at least may share just the odd secret with her.\\nA senior official I saw today also made the point that any holder of Lady Ashton\\'s post would currently be\\nstruggling with teething problems and squabbling as the new foreign policy apparatus created by the\\nLisbon Treaty takes shape. There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy\\'s network against Lady Ashton: she is not a\\nlifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men in\\nsuits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much sympathy for\\nher complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain.\\nFinally, at the risk of sounding too loyal to the British, I think Mr Quatremer is being unfair when he says\\nthat it suits the Foreign Office in London to have Lady Ashton \"sabotage\" the post. My impression is that\\naritich nnvornmpni- fPPlc I (iv Achtnn nePdc a lot of sunnort riaht now and worries she is not getting\\nenough support, but at the same time worries that if she receives too much help in the way of briefings\\nand advice from British officials, she will be seen as a British stooge. That may be a self-serving sort of\\nfear (because it allows the British to offer Lady Ashton lots of help) but it is real enough.\\nOther charges probably have something to them. They certainly chime with things I have been told by\\nother people.\\nBut most damaging, to my mind, is the intimate nature of some of the briefing: this stuff is coming from\\nofficials close to Lady Ashton, or who are senior enough to have significant contact with her. And I can\\nconfirm from my own conversations that people across the whole EU foreign policy machine are asking the\\nsame question: why did she take this huge job, when her instinct seems to be to make it as low key as\\npossible? That is a dangerous question mark to have hanging over you.She is headed downstairs to do a quick interview with Andrea Mitchell and then she\\'s off to the PC.

I was in the room\\nAs recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks faded\\n0\\n0 Mark cvnas\\no c.\\n..q,uk, Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT\\nCopenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost\\namid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated\\nBarack Obama, and insisted on an awful \"dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I know\\nthis? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.\\nChina\\'s strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal made\\nIt look as if the west had failed the world\\'s poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society movements\\nand environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was \"the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and\\nfairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility\", said Christian Aid. \"Rich countries have bullied developing nations,\"\\nfumed Friends of the Earth International.\\nAll very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing in yesterday\\'s Guardian, made\\nthe mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese delegate\\nsaying \"no\", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, who\\ndenounced the Copenhagen accord as \"a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominance\\nof a few countries\".\\nSudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of\\nhaving to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then\\nleft its proxies to savage it in public.\\nHere\\'s what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.\\nObama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi.\\nThe Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50\\nor 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose head of\\nstate was also present for most of the time.\\nWhat I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally,\\ninstead sending a second-tier official in the country\\'s foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub\\nwas obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the world\\'s most powerful\\nheads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his \"superiors\".\\nShifting the blame\\nTo those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was China\\'s representative who insisted\\nthat industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. \"Why can\\'t we even\\nmention our own targets?\" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia\\'s prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyed\\nenough to bang his microphone. Brazil\\'s representative too pointed out the illogicality of China\\'s position. Why should rich\\ncountries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threw\\nup her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that Obama would\\nget the blame for the Copenhagen accord\\'s lack of ambition.\\nChina, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global\\nemissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that\\nemissions should peak \"as soon as possible\". The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No one\\nelse, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese not\\nbeen in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corks\\npopping in every corner of the world.\\nStrong position\\nSo how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn\\'t need\\na deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: \"The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans.\" On\\nthe other hand, western leaders in particular — but also presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa, Calderon of\\nMexico and many others — were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more than\\nanyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation, put serious cuts on the table for\\nthe first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020), and was obviously prepared to up its offer.\\nAbove all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climate\\nregulation framework, so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese\\nindustry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their only\\nopportunity to go to cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks with a strong mandate. This further strengthened China\\'s negotiating hand, as\\ndid the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developing\\ncountries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never broken. The Indians, in particular. have become past masters at ca-\\nopting the language of equity (\"equal rights to the atmosphere\") in the service of planetary suicide — and leftish\\ncampaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard.\\nWith the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted on\\nremoving the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising\\nseas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. \"How can you\\nask my country to go extinct?\" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — and the number\\nstayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.\\nChina\\'s game\\nAll this raises the question: what is China\\'s game? Why did China, in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spent\\nhours in heads of state meetings, \"not only reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take on\\nbinding targets?\" The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years, concludes that China wants\\nto weaken the climate regulation regime now \"in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in a\\nfew years\\' time\".\\nThis does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. But\\nChina\\'s growth, and growing global political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it is\\nbecoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen.\\nIts coal-based economy doubles every decade, and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter this\\nmagic formula unless they absolutely have to.\\nCopenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics. This\\nis fast becoming China\\'s century, yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not only\\nnot a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower\\'s freedom of action. I left Copenhagen more\\ndespondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave of\\noptimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and drained away.\\n[Go]FyiWill give some thought and pass along any names I can think of.\\nJmRELEASE IN PART\\nB1,1.4(B),1.4(D)FYI.He released his hold.

Hope you\\'ve gotten some rest! We\\'re at O\\'Hare on way back to DC\\nToddFyiHere\\'s the update, pieced together from various sources:\\nStarting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene\\nFoster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion\\ncontinued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster\\'s presence is apparently very helpful. Her\\nrelationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)\\nWoodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks\\nare. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push\\non today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to\\nwind up today and resume on Monday.\\nBrown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.\\nThe issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within\\nthe DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too\\nmuch. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also\\nmoved.\\nThe DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson\\'s goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal\\nDodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework\\nrequires consultation, legislation, and implementation.\\nThe role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish\\nlanguage act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.Happy New Year to you as well!

Harold is proposing to send substantive views on the Pfizer casegot them - spoke with Jack right bif he you all spoke last nightTo rebuild Haiti, start with its young people A 700,000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped labor\\nrapidly and instill national pride and confidence.\\nBy Robert Muggah and Robert Maguire\\nJanuary 31, 2010\\nHaiti will need big ideas to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake this\\nmonth. The reported death toll has topped 150,000, and the reconstruction needs are incalculable. How about starting\\nwith a 700,000-strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entity\\nmakes a lot of sense.\\nHaiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% of\\nthe population.\\nDemographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopment\\nand accentuate political instability.\\nAlthough Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth are a wellspring\\nof creativity, talent and potential. You don\\'t need to be a community-development specialist to know that they are\\nstifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities.\\nFortunately, Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the Haitian Constitution\\ncommits citizens to national service, though it has never been activated. What is more, there are many Haitian and\\ninternational organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going.\\nA civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work.\\nThey could start with the once-iconic center of the capital, but also could begin planting trees, working the fields and\\nproviding services in Haiti\\'s countryside.\\nAt a minimum, this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there.\\nThis plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% of youth in their 20s were out\\nof work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring their\\nand their country\\'s pride and dignity.\\nA civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the next\\ncrisis. Hundreds of humanitarian agencies, donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facing\\nmonumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapid\\ndisbursement, transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferring\\ncapital.\\nDirect support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from the\\nbottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals that promote direct\\nmonetary transfers to beneficiaries. Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don\\'t need paternalistic\\nprograms that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards, a civic service corps would circumvent\\nunnecessary administrative costs.\\nFurther, a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions. During past\\ndecades, the state provided relatively few services to Haitians, particularly outside the capital. In some cases, state\\nentities were downright predatory. As a result, nonstate providers, including gangs and shady middlemen, filled the gap.\\nA civic service corps -- wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating the\\ngovernment\\'s presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It would\\nbe a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people.\\nA civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. Haiti is situated in the path of\\nhurricanes and on a fault line, and can expect more disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women\\n-- in the basics of first aid, emergency response, community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate the\\nconsequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management, the corps could provide more intensive\\ntraining in specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications and public health.\\nAn initial step to getting Haiti\\'s youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haiti,\\nincluding the U.N. donor conference scheduled for March. Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluable\\nexperiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmental\\norganization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake, Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited and\\ntrained hundreds of Haitian youth, including former gang members, to provide relief services in Haiti\\'s slums. This\\nprogram could be reactivated and scaled up quickly.\\nA civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for, say, up to two years.\\nThe Haitian government would, of course, need to be the one to manage the undertaking, with direct oversight from the\\npresident\\'s office and the Interior Ministry.\\nAnd there are many countries that could provide advice and support.\\nNongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essential\\nskills.\\nHaiti\\'s youth are the future of the nation, and they are central to Haiti\\'s recovery. A civic service corps is a large-scale\\nway to quickly mobilize them to act as catalyst for long-term, progressive changes.\\nRobert Muggah, based at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, is a principal of\\nthe SecDev Group and is currently advising multilateral and bilateral organizations on Haiti\\'s recovery. Robert Maguire is\\non the faculty of Trinity Washington University and chairs the Haiti Working Group of the United States Institute of\\nPeace in Washington.\\nCopyright (c) 2010, The Los Angeles TimesOkBjk has also been in very close touch with nina bishop, who does great work in the sports united office (under ECA).

He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for Immunization to transform the\\nglobal system of vaccine financing, and worked to secure donor commitments of more than $5 billion for this\\nfacility. Before joining the Gates Foundation, Shah was a health care policy advisor on the Al Gore presidential\\ncampaign, 2000 and a member of Governor Ed Rendell\\'s (D-PA) transition committee on health.\\nShah earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and M.Sc. in Health Economics\\nat the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan and\\nalso attended the London School of Economics.\\nPresident Obama announced Shah\\'s selection as Under Secretary of Research, Education, and Economics and\\nChief Scientist on April 17, 2009. Shah\\'s nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous\\nconsent on May 12, 2009.\\nEarly life and family\\nBorn to Indian immigrant parents who settled in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the late 60\\'s, Raj Shah grew up in the\\nDetroit area and attended Wylie Groves High School.\\nHe lives with his wife, Shivam, and their two young children, Sajan and Amna. He has one sister, Ami Shah,\\nwho is a medical doctor.\\nCareer\\nRaj Shah is currently the Under Secretary of Research, Education and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at\\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture.

He oversaw grant portfolios in science and technology; farmer\\nproductivity; market access; and policy, statistics and advocacy; and managed a team of more than 60\\nprofessionals. He also developed innovative partnerships with private industry, the United Nations, the World\\nBank, and country governments around the world, where he was an active voice on issues related to food and\\nhunger.\\nAs the Foundation\\'s first Director for the Financial Services to the Poor portfolio, Shah worked with a broad\\nrange of financial institutions and other donors to determine how Foundation resources could best amplify the\\nfield\\'s collective impact. Previously, he led the Strategic Opportunities initiative which worked with Foundation\\nco-chairs to identify, assess and recommend new areas of giving. This process led to the creation of the\\nFoundation\\'s Global Development Program.\\nShah\\'s early work with the Foundation focused on global health. As Deputy Director for Policy and Finance,\\nRaj managed the Foundation\\'s $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine Fund — an effort referred to by Bill and\\nMelinda Gates as their best investment. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for\\nImmunization to transform the global system of vaccine financing and worked to secure donor commitments of\\nmore than $5 billion for this facility. The World Health Organization estimates this initiative will save more\\nthan five million children\\'s lives through the next decade, and a New York Times article described the effort as\\n\"a clever way to reduce the burden of costly diseases now and save money in the future.\"\\nShah previously worked as a health care policy advisor on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign, was an active\\nsupporter of the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008, and served as a member of Pennsylvania Governor\\nEd Rendell\\'s health transition committee.

This is not a COIN strategy,\" Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week,\\nusing the military\\'s shorthand for counterinsurgency. \"This is not \\'go out and occupy the whole country.\\' \" \" Washbost\\nIt appears that the Afghan policy war is not over.

McChrystal that he was not granting McChrystal\\'s request to double the size of the Afghan army and police.\\nCost was a factor, as were questions about whether the capacity exists to train 400,000 personnel. The president told\\nMcChrystal, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, to focus for now on fielding a little more than\\nhalf that number by next October.\\nTen days after Obama\\'s speech, the U.S. command responsible for training the Afghans circulated a chart detailing the\\ncombined personnel targets for the army and police. McChrystal\\'s goal of 400,000 remained unchanged.\\n\"It\\'s an open issue,\" a senior Pentagon official said last week.\\nNearly a month after Obama unveiled his revised Afghanistan strategy, military and civilian leaders have come away with\\ndiffering views of several fundamental aspects of the president\\'s new approach, according to more than a dozen senior\\nadministration and military officials involved in Afghanistan policy, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to\\ndiscuss internal deliberations.\\nMembers of Obama\\'s war cabinet disagree over the meaning of his pledge to begin drawing down forces in July 2011 and\\nwhether the mission has been narrowed from a proposal advanced by McChrystal in his August assessment of the war.\\nThe disagreements have opened a fault line between a desire for an early exit among several senior officials at the White\\nHouse and a conviction among military commanders that victory is still achievable on their terms.\\nThe differences are complicating implementation of the new strategy. Some officers have responded to the July 2011 date\\nby seeking to accelerate the pace of operations, instead of narrowing them. At the White House, a senior administration\\nofficial said, the National Security Council is discussing ways to increase monitoring of military and State Department\\nactivities in Afghanistan to prevent \"overreaching.\"\\nThe NSC\\'s strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president\\'s new approach, was described by the\\nsenior administration official as limiting military operations \"in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve two\\ngoals -- to prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government.\" The use of resource-\\nintensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed to\\nbe restricted to key cities and towns in southern and eastern parts of the country, the official said.\\n\"The strategy has fundamentally changed. This is not a COIN strategy,\" Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week,\\nusing the military\\'s shorthand for counterinsurgency. \"This is not \\'go out and occupy the whole country.\\' \"\\nSetting limits\\nDuring a videoconference two days before the speech, Obama made it clear to McChristal and U.S. Ambassador Karl W.\\nEikenberry that he did not want the additional troops to fuel a broader mission. Speaking to both men from the White\\nHouse Situation Room, the president told them not to deploy the forces to areas they would not be able to transfer to\\nAfghan security forces by July 2011, according to two senior officials with knowledge of the conversation.\\nObama\\'s essential instruction was, according to one of the officials, \"Don\\'t bite off more than you can chew.\"\\nWhite House officials said the president opposes using the forces he has authorized to duplicate an expansive, iraq-style\\ncounterinsurgency operation -- in part because he questions whether it will be possible to achieve a similar outcome in\\nAfghanistan, which is less developed, and because he wants to start reducing troops in 18 months. The White House\\'s\\ndesired end state in Afghanistan, officials said, envisions more informal local security arrangements than in Iraq, a less-\\ncapable national government and a greater tolerance of insurgent violence.\\nSenior military officials still think they can achieve a better outcome than envisaged by civilian skeptics in the\\nadministration by using the new forces to mount more comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagon\\nstrategists and McChrystal\\'s advisers in Kabul are looking at how they can fulfill the White House desire for a less\\nextensive mission, military officials said they are reluctant to strip too much away and weaken an approach that has come\\nto be revered within the ranks as the only way to suppress guerrilla movements.\\nMilitary officials contend that McChrystal does not harbor expansionist aims. They note that he has begun removing\\ntroops from remote mountain valleys and concentrating resources on a modest number of key population centers. But the\\napproach in those areas will involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops will focus on restoring normal patterns of life by\\ntrying to keep the Taliban at bay, helping the Afghan government provide basic services to the population and training\\nlocal security forces.\\nMcChrystal\\'s plan, the senior Pentagon official said, \"is still counterinsurgency, regardless of the various agendas people\\nare trying to spin.\"\\nDissent over drawdown\\nDuring strategy discussions at the White House, differences between the White House and the military came into sharp\\nrelief over °baffle\\'s decision to announce his intention to begin drawing down troops in July 2011.\\nMcChrystal argued against it, according to three officials familiar with the process. The head of the U.S. Central\\nCommand, Gen. David H. Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama to\\nmake the drawdoWn \"conditions-based.\"\\n\"There was a lot of push back\" from the Defense Department, one of the officials said.\\nThe president received cover from one uniformed general at the table, James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint\\nChiefs of Staff. Cartwright had adopted a more skeptical view of the mission than many of his military colleagues, one that\\nresonated with Obama and Biden.\\nCartwright effectively endorsed the July 2011 date, arguing that increasing forces and engaging in limited\\ncounterinsurgency made sense, the senior administration official said, \"but given the risk factors -- Pakistan, the Karzai\\ngovernment, the whole notion of sub-national governance and our track record with the [Afghan security forces], which is\\nnot prestigious -- that it made sense to demonstrate that we could actually do this.\"\\nIt. also helped Obama that the principal troop-increase proposal being discussed at the time -- a recommendation that\\nMcChrystal receive 30,000 forces for 18 to 24 months -- had been developed by Gates. The Defense Department\\npaperwork detailing the proposal identified the increase as starting in the summer of 2009, when the first troops deployed\\nby the president this year began conducting operations in Afghanistan, but it did not specify an end date.\\n\"Rather than leaving this indefinite and hypothetical, the president\\'s intervention was to say, \\'Okay, if we\\'re starting in July\\nof \\'09, then we\\'re really talking about July of \\'11,\" said the senior administration official who described the NSC guidance.\\nObama eventually told his war cabinet that he would announce the July 2011 deadline but that the pace of withdrawals\\nwould be determined, as Gates had sought, by conditions on the ground. Obama said he would conduct a thorough\\nreview of progress in a year\\'s time. Although he did not endorse McChrystal\\'s request to increase the Afghan security\\nforces to 400,000, he said he would reevaluate the issue once the 2010 goal of training 230,000 forces is achieved.\\nThe president avoided details in his Dec. 1 address, leaving it up to members of his Cabinet and to his advisers to explain\\nthe specifics. The result has been a wide divergence of expectations. Gates, appearing on NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press\" the\\nSunday after the speech, said that perhaps only \"some handful or some small number\" would be withdrawn. Biden, during\\nhis MSNBC appearance last week, said a chart showing an increase in U.S. deployments this year would be \"coming\\ndown as rapidly over the next two years.\"\\nThe ambiguity over the meaning of the July 2011 deadline has generated uncertainty over the presidents intent. \"Is the\\nsurge a way of helping us leave more quickly, or is the timeline a way to help win support for the surge?\" asked a senior\\nDemocratic staff member in Congress. \"Which is the strategy and which is the head-fake? Nobody knows.\"\\nOne senior military officer in Afghanistan said he and his fellow soldiers \"don\\'t know if this is all over in 18 months, or\\nwhether this is just a progress report that leads to minor changes.\"\\n\"Until they tell us otherwise,\" the officer said, \"we\\'re operating as if the latter is the policy.\"\\nA \\'dramatic change\\'?\\nAlthough senior-level civilians in the administration emerged from the review process thinking the mission had been\\ncircumscribed, senior military officials continue to have a different view. The result, as they see it, is that the White House\\nhas embraced McChrystal\\'s original plan.\\n\"We had already been pretty focused that we wouldn\\'t try to clear and hold things more than we needed to,\" said a senior\\ncommander involved in the war. \"It wasn\\'t a dramatic change by any means.\"\\nWhite House officials have cited a meeting among NSC staff members and McChrystal in which the general displayed a\\nslide stating that his mission was to \"Defeat the Taliban,\" which some civilians deemed overly ambitious because it\\nsuggested that every last member of the Taliban would have to be killed or captured. The officials said the mission was\\nredefined to avoid the term.\\nBut to military officers, defeat \"doesn\\'t mean wipe everyone out,\" the commander said. \"It means after Waterloo,\\nNapoleon still had an army but he wasn\\'t going to threaten Europe. We used that view when we worked defeat.\"\\nEven before the White House review had finished, the commander in charge of day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M.\\nRodriguez, had developed a plan to concentrate U.S. and NATO efforts in 80 of the country\\'s nearly 400 districts.\\n\"They\\'re taking credit for some of the things that McChrystal was already doing and calling it a narrowed focus,\" a senior\\nmilitary official said.\\nWhite House advisers maintain that the review process did refine the mission beyond what McChrystal had proposed over\\nthe summer.\\n\"There was a real narrowing here,\" the senior administration official said. \"Stan has a big leadership task to adapt his\\noriginal concept to the new strategic guidance.\"\\nThe official said NSC officials recognize it will take time for the new orders to filter through the ranks. \"This doesn\\'t turn\\naround with a speech,\" the official said. \"But I hope we don\\'t see slides a month from now that continue to state that our\\ngoal is 400,000\" Afghan security forces.\\nThe challenge, said that official and another senior administration official, is to recalibrate military operations over the next\\n18 months in accordance with the new goal.\\n\"The guidance they have is that we\\'re not doing everything, and we\\'re not doing it forever,\" the second official said. \"The\\nhardest intellectual exercise will be settling on how much is enough.\"\\nFor now, however, top military officers speak more expansively than White House advisers.\\n\"Winning means we hand off to a security force that can secure the country,\" the senior Pentagon official said. \"We\\'ve\\nseparated the enemy, we\\'ve connected the people to the government, and we\\'re helping them to rebuild their economy.\\nIt\\'s at that point that we begin to transition it over to them.\"\\nTerms such as \"winning\" and \"victory\" have been eschewed by the White House. Obama did not use either in his Dec. 1\\naddress, and he said in an interview earlier this year that he was uncomfortable using the term \"victory\" when fighting \"a\\nnon-state actor, a shadowy operation like al-Qaeda.\"\\nBut when Gates visited Kabul a week after Obama\\'s speech, he made a point of telling military personnel there that \"we\\nare in this thing to win.\"\\n\"From a moral perspective, when you ask soldiers and families to sacrifice, we do that to win,\" the Pentagon official said.\\n\"We need to be able to articulate winning.\"Agree and he speaks fluent English so no translation needed.FyiMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nFriday, December 25, 2009 10:41 PM\\nH\\nRe: Happy Holidays!\\nCdmYes - calling now.Yes, vali is working on an answer sheet for some of the tough q and a like blackwater, drones, quetta shura and nuclear\\nsecurity.

You should have it in the next few minutes.Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:\\nBy Michael Posner\\nThe Post\\'s Dec. 27 editorial (\"Redefining Human Rights\") on the Obama Administration\\'s human rights and\\ndemocracy policies, and Secretary Clinton\\'s recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point:\\nhuman rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement\\neach other in the task of making human rights a human reality.\\nPresident Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together\\nfreedom of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous \"Four Freedoms\"\\nspeech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom.\\nTo accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes\\ndevelopment in a discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also\\nwalls off a crucial avenue for ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs -\\nincluding the rights to freedom of religion, association, and speech-in their daily lives.\\nAs Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: \"Freedom doesn\\'t\\ncome in half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem,\" she said. But experience shows\\nus that where broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures,\\nand governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable\\npolice and fair courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to\\nspeak freely, to participate in their nation\\'s political process and have access to basic information about\\ngovernment, sustainable development is more likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without\\ndevelopment do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed to\\npursuing both simultaneously.\\nAs President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, \"engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity\\nof indignation.\" But the Post\\'s overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and women\\nwho worked to advance human rights around the world.\\nTo suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in which\\nshe forcefully criticized specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse for\\nany regime, this is an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and to\\nensure that democracy actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the right\\napproach for the Obama Administration and for the 21st century.\\n###Great.

Apparently\\nthere is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza\\'s party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had\\nno choice.\\nThat said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his\\nsupport with two conditions: (1) don\\'t interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously\\nand don\\'t carry the ALBA countries\\' water.\\nCraig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had\\nan impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.\\nBottom line: Craig said we couldn\\'t have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions on\\nPinera\\'s support.I will be traveling today, February 11, returning late Sunday, February 14, with intermittent access to my email.

Nye\\n2010-02-10\\nCAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would\\nwin. In today\\'s information age, politics is also about whose \"story\" wins.\\nNational narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other\\norganizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between\\nthe government and protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played\\ncrucial roles, or the recent controversy between Google and China.\\nReputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a \"paradox of\\nplenty.\" When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell\\nmay, more than ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.\\nFor example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British\\ngovernments, has paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya\\nKikwete\\'s day: \"he rises at dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.\"\\nSkeptics who treat the term \"public diplomacy\" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple\\npropaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations\\ncampaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment\\nfor government policies.\\nThe contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three\\ndimensions or stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension\\nis daily communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This\\ndimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event,\\nothers will rush in to fill it.\\nThe second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political\\nor advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over\\nweeks, months, and even years.\\nThe third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over\\nmany years or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to\\nmedia channels. These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the\\ncrucial \"last three feet\" — face-to-face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.\\nBut even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it\\ncuts against the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public\\ndiplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried\\nto enhance its soft power by successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown\\nin Tibet — and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains.\\nGreat powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not\\nalways understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign\\npolicy undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy \"on steroids,\" staffed by diplomats trained in\\nnew media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under-\\nrepresented groups.\\nThe centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to\\ncorrect daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message.\\nThe main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness\\nand set the agenda. But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different\\ncultural settings. The sender knows what she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt\\nto distort what is heard.\\nNetworked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-\\npeer relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for\\ngovernments to accomplish, given their central accountability structures.\\nThe greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call\\n\"the new public diplomacy,\" which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct\\ngovernmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building\\nrelationships with civil-society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental\\nparties at home and abroad.\\nIn this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than\\ncontrolling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can\\nundercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from\\none-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.\\nPower in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard\\ndimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called \"smart power.\" For\\n-\\nexample, the current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, and\\nover-reliance on hard power alone is not the path to success.\\nPublic diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an\\nunderstanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If it\\ndegenerates into propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead,\\nit must remain a two-way process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding the\\nminds of others.Yes.

But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sitting\\ndown with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care reform\\npossible.\\nOver the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of\\ntimes to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration\\'s health care reform agenda in\\nexchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president\\'s promises to reform the pharmaceutical\\nindustry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push\\ntheir case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts, disclosure forms including lobbying reports and Federal\\nElection Commission records, White House visitor logs and the sghedu! ..S,:::in. Max,Baucus releases yoiun:tarily--is a\\ntestament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington.\\nIn the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation\\'s health\\ncare system, but also supported key qemocr.atic health reform uok,\\nsies. Among these were several that targeted the\\npharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and providing\\nMedicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program. These weren\\'t\\njust promises, Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Rdl Call Vote 132 and Roll call Vo.t.c.-)\\n150.)\\nSet to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staff\\nRahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina. Emanuel was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official,\\ninvestment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress. Messina was the former campaign manager\\nB6\\nand chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their\\nunparalleled legislative abilities.\\nBecause of Obama\\'s decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress also\\nplayed key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee\\nchairman Max Bpuf.\\n-4:s. Baucus would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and\\nPhRMA.\\nCentral to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member of\\nCongress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties\\nTauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy &\\nCommerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington\\'s mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription\\ndrug access to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare would\\nnot be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not be\\nallowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and would be taking a\\njob helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.\\nTauzin\\'s job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of\\n2008 simply titled \".Biliy.\" It featured the candidate, sleeves rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the\\nways of Washington. \"The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate\\nwith drug companies. And you know what, the chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for\\nthe pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year.\" The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, \"Barack\\nObama is the only candidate who refuses Washington lobbyist money,\" while the candidate continues his lecture,\\n\"Imagine that. That\\'s an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I don\\'t want to learn how to\\nplay the game better, I want to put an end to the game playing.\"\\nAiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.\\nOver the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group sdeft:tow::!i: _ 520 tniliion on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from\\nPhRMA\\'s massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number of\\nlobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists representing PhRMA were former\\nemployees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers including\\ntwo former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.\\nAccording to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers coptr.ibu■ed sums to ....:ongressional\\necii-om.lttee.s during the same period--from January to the end of October (4thquarter numbers are still being\\ntotaled), industry political action committees, employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million.\\nThose contributions tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in any\\nelection cycle going back to 1990, the first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that\\nDemocrats were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President\\'s intention to reform America\\'s\\nhealth care system, the new tilt was perhaps not surprising.\\nOn March 5, the White House a Tee.tiilfa....ivitfi.rnnic!r_nealth care induLd.er.s to try to bring them to the table and\\nsee what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist for\\nPhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America\\'s Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman Karen lgnani, Tom Donohue of the\\nChamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations\\' Rise Lavizzomourey.

Spme were duri?0,7rognnd,,\\n,td by this apparent change of\\nheart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.\\nOn April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a\\nmeeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor\\nand health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote\\nreform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entftelv funoed pj\\n.\\nPhRMA. The two groups spent $24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went to\\nWhite House Senior Advisor David AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million.\\nIn the next month, CEO\\'s from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least\\nfour times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health\\ncare reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups piedaed cost ,\\n..-v_itting_measures to the White House that\\nwould save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the State\\nDining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up with a media blitz in the press\\nand on the White House Web site.\\nThe next day, Healthy Economy Now\\'s PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement in support of the health\\ncare reform process calling for the government to finally \"fix\" the nation\\'s health care cost problems. While many elements\\nof the $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they\\ncould ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House:\\nThe first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA\\'s top executives, including Tauzin, and industry\\nCEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly available\\nschedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee\\nchairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.\\nIn a press release featuring a statement by Tauzin, Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80\\nbillion in cost cutting measures to be included in the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news\\nre_gorts, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June\\n2 were able to win the lower figure.\\nThe terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the \"donut hole\" in Medicare\\nprescription drug coverage. The \"donut hole\" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare prescription\\ndrug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2,700 spent\\nand does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal; 50 percent\\ncoverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the \"donut hole.\"\\nIn Baucus\\' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we\\ncan make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today.\" This \"once-in-a-lifetime\" opportunity also extended to the\\npharmaceutical industry\\'s ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through\\nMedicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grand\\nstatement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the White\\nHouse and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.\\nBaucus proceeded with a_pia,n c.c)r\\n.ivene.a bicartisap rimuo in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House.\\nThese participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi and\\nOlympia Snowe. Baucus\\' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which were\\nreliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to meet the\\nWhite House\\'s announced iltuouet reces§ dee&rie for passing health care reform.\\nSoon after, PhRMA\\'s big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met with\\nRehm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus\\' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this\\nmeeting). In August, The Huffirytorj. !Dosi\\',.\\n--; Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that\\noutlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicare\\nprescription drug negotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D\\nand Part B. The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.\\n***\\nWhile the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus\\' committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up their\\nown versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the\\nfinal product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the\\n$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gotten\\nthe White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation. Medicare negotiating power\\nand speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by the\\ncommittee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreed\\nto by the White House, Baucus and PhRMA.\\nThe cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of the\\nCEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public\\nwith the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4, the Los Ancg•3les•Firrief-\\n,\\n-\\n:, in\\nan exclusive report, featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and\\nthat, as Tauzin put it, \"The White House blessed it.\" Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, \"For his part, Tauzin said he had\\nnot only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to\\npursue another proposal Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe.\"\\nThe White House\\'s Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin\\'s claim, stating, \"The president encouraged this approach ... He\\nwanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform.\"\\nDemocratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijaiva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked, \"Are industry groups\\ngoing to be the ones at the table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?\"\\n***\\nOn September 7, Baucus\\' bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed\\n$80 billion. Five days later, the New York :limes reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an\\nadvertising blitz in support of Baucus\\' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending \"...would be a follow-up to the deal that\\ndrug makers struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House.\" On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his\\nles.j\\n.islation to the public. t\\nThe White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendment\\ntargeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest\\nMedicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to push\\nfor further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the \"donut hole\" completely.\\nNelson claimed that his amendment would onerate $106 billion in revenue, or from PhRMA\\'s perspective increase their\\ncost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to the\\npharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted with\\nRepublicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment. It is little surprise the Carper\\'s Delaware is home to\\nAstraZeneca and Menendez\\' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, all of which lobbied for the $80\\nbillion cap.\\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on November 19. Debate began on Dec.\\n3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced an\\namendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal Drug Administration\\n(FDA) released a letter objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: \"...as currently\\nwritten, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there are\\nsignificant safety concerns.\" Dorgan\\'s amendment was defeated with numerous Democrats previously in support of\\nreimportation switching to \"no\" votes.\\nOn Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.\\n***\\nNew Year\\'s Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill\\nhad been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted\\nKennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the\\nsenator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.\\nDespite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda, particularly\\nhealth care reform.\\nin the end, the pharmaceutical industry\\'s support for health care reform would be left up in the air.

Petraeus didn\\'t tell that story to disdain the possibility. He smiled\\nand watched closely for reaction from others.

These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact that\\nthey happened is not off limits.\\nPetraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new, perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked to\\nhim that if I Twilt.-\\n-s\\n,rgc, that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time I\\'d seen him out of\\nuniform, an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC.\\nIn August of 2007, I wroteoiece, stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus might\\nrun for President in 2012. In April 2008, Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled \"The\\nGeneral\" referencing my earlier take.\\nRecently, legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated the topic of an Eisenhoweresque future for the\\ncounterinsurgency guru in his piece, \"President ?etraeus7\"\\nPetraeus was recently named as one of Foreign Policy magazine\\'s tip 100 ttzal thinkers, and as U.S. News & World\\nReports \"Washington Whispers\" notes, he is going to be speaking in May 2010 at the annual American Enterprise\\nInstitute dinner receiving the Irving Kristol Award.\\nIn January 2010, Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card race\\nagainst Petraeus, the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public just\\ndidn\\'t know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion:\\nFinally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card Republican this month and his\\nnumbers come out as a mixed bag. He has the largest deficit against Obama, trailing 44-34. But at +13\\nhis net favorability is better than the President or any of the other Republicans we tested. The problem for\\nhim is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country don\\'t know enough about him to\\nhave formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics, but\\nif he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time.\\nPresident Obama himself, according to what some of his aides have reported to me, is quite taken with David Petraeus\\nand respects his approach and thinking.\\nPetraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might react\\nto a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked, Petraeus offered a cryptic rather than\\nclear response. (see above video)\\nAt the \"First Draft of History\" meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group, the Newseum, and the\\nAspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic review\\non Afghanistan responded that he \"would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could.\"\\nContrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr\\n.j., \"We will salute and execute [the\\nPresident\\'s] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability.\"\\nBut after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years, there is no way that\\nthis intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Party\\ntakeover of the Republican political machine.\\nThere is always the possibility that a core of reasonable Republicans like Michael Bloomberg, James Baker, Olympia\\nSnowe, Chuck Hegel, Alan Simpson, John Whitehead, Peter Peterson, Rita Hauser and others will try to rekindle classic\\nRepublican sensibilities by fighting to re-hijack their party back in an Eisenhower-like campaign with Petraeus at the lead.\\nRemember that Eisenhower clinched the Republican nomination by promising to be the President who though he knew\\nwar would end the Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan and Iraq -- and though it seems hard to envision today could\\nbe the kind of leader promising to end those wars if Obama proves unable to do so.\\nBut there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic David Petraeus running\\nfor President -- and that is his running for Vice President.\\nI think Vice President Joe Biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the Obama White House, Biden\\nhas done the best job of outperforming expectations. He had given President Obama much needed counsel, not always\\ntaken regrettably, but counsel that Obama needed to show the American public he was getting. Biden has been the key\\nagent behind the scenes in moving Iraq\\'s elections forward. He has scored a lot of wins -- not reported -- in the\\nnuclear/WMD controls arena. Biden has worked with Gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship with\\nRussia -- and his counterpoints on the Afghanistan surge, in my view, remain compelling.\\nBut Biden is going to have to find a way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it.\\nAs I look at it now, Hillary Clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as Secretary of State would\\nbe a natural candidate for the Obama VP slot. Her franchise is not completely in the control of the Obama team yet, but\\nmoving Hillary closer to the White House (although her private home on Whitehaven Street is actually a couple of hundred\\nfeet closer to the White House than the VP residence at the Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarna\\'s takeover of all the\\nkey political franchises in the Democratic Party -- starting with Daley\\'s machine, Deschle\\'s machine, Kennedy\\'s machine,\\nEdwards\\' machine, and then the Clintons\\'.\\nBut General David Petraeus, in his business suit, lurks out there. Obama seems to be concerned about looking like he is\\nweak on national security. The Republicans -- at Cheney\\'s constant goading (and now Sarah Palin\\'s) -- seem to want to\\ncontinue to play politics through fear-mongering.\\nObama could neutralize the possibility that he faces a Republican party challenge by David Petraeus by inviting the\\nGeneral on to the 2012 ticket as a Democrat.\\nCrazy? Perhaps.\\nBut inviting potential rivals into his tent is becoming a standard Obama trademark -- much as he did by appointing\\nRepublican Governor of Utah and former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade Representative Jon Huntsman, Jr.\\nto serve as US Ambassador to the People\\'s Republic of China.\\nAnd get this, we have just learned that David Petraeus has not voted since 2002 -- not because he doesn\\'t care to vote --\\nbut reportedly because he wants to keep his eventual political options and political loyalties open.\\nThis is a soldier for whom all options are on the table and who is keeping his powder dry.\\nMy hunch is that whether Obama sticks with Vice President Biden or pivots to someone else, Petraeus will be on the short\\nlist of those considered.\\n-- Steve Clemons publishes the popular political blog, The Washington Note.sbwhoeop\\nSaturday, February 13, 2010 10:41 AM\\nRe: also...\\nyes, Luce will publish on Monday.

The president must\\nchange key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It\\'s mostly a\\nmatter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with proven\\nrecords of getting things done in Washington and the world.\\nTo be fair, it\\'s not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama or\\nhis White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking far\\nbeyond their experience in that realm. Unless you\\'re there, you don\\'t know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and except\\nfor the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who\\'s got to be helped. So\\nit is they who\\'ve got to go.\\nIt is he who\\'s got to be helped. So it is they who\\'ve got to go.\\nOne may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it\\'s hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—and\\nespecially in Washington—that doesn\\'t descend into ripping Obama\\'s White House team. The refrain of complaints is\\nalways the same:\\n• Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not \"begrudge\" Wall\\nStreeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple of\\nweeks ago that such big bonuses were \"shameful.\"\\n• Obama doesn\\'t know what\\'s really going on. Regarding the Middle East, he recently said that \"I think it is absolutely true\\nthat what we did this year didn\\'t produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some of\\nthese political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high.\" He had to be totally out of it\\nnot to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing.\\n• Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn\\'t recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone know\\nhow to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and says he\\nis \"an eternal optimist—when those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don\\'t see any common\\nground and believe the administration has to \"scrap the bill and start over.\"\\n• It\\'s even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a \"war of necessity\" and orders more than 30,000\\nnew troops there, coupled with an announcement that he\\'ll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to see\\nsome of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won\\'t.\\nI\\'ve scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luce\\nprovided a thunderclap on Washington\\'s negative consensus about the incompetence of Obarna\\'s Chicago-laden team.\\nLuce named names in the White House, and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story.\\nThey were said to fear the wrath of the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentially\\neridorse.d the Luce finding and slapped his fellow bloggers\\' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious as\\nit was during the Carter administration. There, two very capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan and Jody\\nPowell—moved into critical White House positions without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. And\\nthey were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They also added to the \"them\" versus \"us\" (Washington insiders and\\nbureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia) mentality that plagues most administrations.\\nThe Chicagoans and others \"guarding\" the president create their own \"us versus them\" world. It\\'s hard to imagine a policy\\nconversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has Washington\\nor policy experience. And there isn\\'t much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge the president\\non a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team.\\nHere are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chief\\nof staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I\\'ve talked to believes he has the management skills and\\ndiscipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and the\\ntime to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the University\\nof North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White House chief as well\\nunder Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another former\\nClinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage.\\nReplace Lawrence Summers, director of the White House\\'s National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the former\\nchairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he\\'s been beaten up and is said to want\\nout anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in a\\nposition to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama\\'s weekly gyrations. Others with\\nproven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer,\\nVincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars in\\nWashington who\\'d improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit\\nInsurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above all\\nwould help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman and\\npolicy head.\\nDavid Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign,\\nwherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable voice.\\nGood replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom Deschle, the\\nformer Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in unofficial\\nresidence at the White House, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and Chicago\\nbuddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role in making\\npolicy.\\nMr. Obama\\'s crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It\\'s nice, but not nearly\\nenough.\\nRobert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let\\'s put it this way: He wasn\\'t born for daily jousts with pithy\\nRepublicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible\\nsuccessors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or Helene Cooper of The New York\\nTimes.\\nLast but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admired\\nand respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO\\'s military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But by\\nwide acclamation inside and outside the White House, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirement\\nof this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and precise\\nplans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, is\\nZbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter\\'s national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and\\nknows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig\\'s lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia.\\nAlso available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform the\\nNational Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try former\\nambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. They\\nhave it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama on\\nstrategy.\\nYes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They all\\npossess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a critical\\nbonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to succeed them in two or\\nthree years. To lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems as\\nintellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition in\\nsensing what\\'s achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to make\\nadjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to succeed in small\\nas well as large ways.

Bush was in the White House. He said Mr Obama had\\nthree options with healthcare reform. First, try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation process,\\nwhich would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in a\\nelection defeat in Massachusetts.\\nThe second would be to pass a watered down bill with Republican support The third would be to abandon the attempt,\\nas Mr Clinton did in 1993.\\nMr Podesta, whom Mr Obama still regularly consults, said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reform\\nthrough. \"The worst option among the three is doing nothing, and so they\\'re going to have to figure out which track is\\nviable,\" he said. \"It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such, then so be it.\"\\nHe painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. \"It sucks,\" he said. Pointing to a strategy of\\nobstructionism by Republican lawmakers, he said: \"I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans, but,\\nquite frankly, he\\'s not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. He\\'s dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin.\"\\nThe growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threatening\\nto turn the US into, \"in essence, a parliamentary system without majority rule\", where the opposition automatically\\nopposes any serious initiatives.\\nThe political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole, he said. Since the 1978 passage of\\nProposition 13 in the state, all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. \"And so nothing gets done.\"\\nMichael H.

What\\'s going around...Les Gelb... Sid\\nambling Over Rahm\\nby Leslie H. Gelb\\nFebruary 22, 2010 I 3:26pm\\n-\\nL - Alex Brandon / AP Photo Leslie H. Gelb\\'s call for White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to\\nbe reassigned spurred a circle-the-wagons reaction from pro- (or perhaps even anti-) Rahm forces.\\nGelb sifts the fallout for clues.\\nWhen you write that the president of the United States should replace his chief of staff, someone will fire back. So it was\\nthat Rahm Emanuel apparently struck back at my piece last week on the Daily Beast through a column in Sunday\\'s\\nWashington Post. Only this time, the return fire had a rare twist, one that could produce Washington convulsions. It was\\nseemingly aimed at me (and others who published suggestions of Emanuel\\'s limitations as chief). But whether it was\\nintentional or not, the volley actually struck the president himself.\\nHere is the story, a very Washington tale of stretching permissible criticism of power holders, of pungent media leaks, of\\nlabyrinthine speculation as to who is doing what to whom.\\nMaybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of Rahm completely was to brand him as a \"traitor\" to the boss.\\nWith a headline \"Replace Rahm,\" I wrote last Tuesday that Emanuel lacked the managerial skills, discipline, and strategic\\nability to get things done as chief of staff. I argued he should be moved over to a political adviser slot, where his\\nconsiderable, can-do talents would better serve his boss. I targeted others as well, mostly in Mr. Obama\\'s Chicago crowd.\\nSeveral writers also blasted this crowd, mostly with unsigned bullets, but never crossed the red line calling for their\\nremoval. I wrote the piece because it essentially reflected the waves of anti-White House staff critiques breaking over\\nWashington, but rarely heard outside its drawing rooms. I did it because I believed the president was running out of\\nchances to succeed and needed better and tougher staffers. I did it because if he failed, the nation failed.\\nThen came the inevitable blast back, a devastating leak, in a piece by Dana Milbank, a respected Washington journalist.\\nInteresting that the leaker selected Milbank. He\\'s sort of a half-reporter, half-columnist who roams the entire capital city,\\nnot just the White House. The leaker must have felt safe because Milbank has so many sources all over town, making the\\nleakers harder to trace.\\nThe Milbank headline read: \"Why Obama needs Rahm at the top.\" It began: \"Let us now praise Rahm Emanuel. No,\\nseriously.\" Then, he lists me and a couple others who also criticized Rahm. \"But,\" he continued, \"sacking Emanuel is the\\nlast thing the president should do.\"\\nThen, Milbank (and presumably the leaker) delivered the surprise and wounding blow – to the president himself. \"Obama\\'s\\nfirst year fell apart in large part because he didn\\'t follow his chief of staffs advice on crucial matters. Arguably, Emanuel is\\nthe only person keeping Obama from becoming Jimmy Carter.\"\\nThen, Milbank (and the leaker) took his first shot, not at me, but at congressional liberals and everyone in the Chicago\\ncrowd except Rahm. \"Obama\\'s problem,\" Milbank continued, \"is that his other confidants—particularly Valerie Jarrett and\\nRobert Gibbs, and, to a lesser extent, David Axelrod—are part of the Cult of Obama. In love with the president, they\\nbelieve he is a transformational figure who needn\\'t dirty his hands in politics.\"\\nSo, it was \"their\" fault—until you see the real blow landed beyond them and on the President himself. \"The president\\nwould have been better off heeding Emanuel\\'s counsel,\" but instead \"overruled\" him on several key Rahm\\nrecommendations: not rushing to close Guantanamo and bringing terrorists to U.S. prisons, not trying Khalid Sheikh\\nMohammed in New York, and going for a smaller health care bill focused on popular items with Republican support. \"The\\nresult was,\" Milbank wrote, \"as the world now knows, disastrous.\" In other words, Mr. Obama could have thrived and\\nsaved himself on key issues had he only listened to Rahm.\\nIt sure looks like Rahm (or someone near and dear to him) trying to save himself at the president\\'s expense. This is an\\nincredibly unusual leak, seemingly a chief of staff undermining his own boss, the president. Worse, it details specific\\nadvice Rahm personally gave Mr. Obama in the absolute privacy of the Oval Office. Presidents go crazy at such breaches\\nof confidence.\\nWhich is why another possibility has to be considered: that Rahm was not the leaker. The leak was so egregious, so anti-\\nChicago crowd minus Rahm, so devastating to the president, that Emanuel couldn\\'t have been stupid enough to leak a\\nstory where he was the sole, surviving hero. Remember, too, that my piece did not recommend kicking Rahm out of the\\nWhite House, just sliding him over into a political adviser job where he could practice small-bite pragmatism. Maybe\\nsomeone didn\\'t want Rahm around the White House at all, in any position. Maybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of\\nRahm completely was to brand him as a \"traitor\" to the boss. Maybe the leaker belonged to that contingent of self-\\nmutilating liberal Democrats who have always viewed Rahm as too centrist and pragmatic.\\nOf course, I don\\'t know what\\'s afoot. And of course, Milbank put his own views into his own article. But someone gave him\\nthe specifics, the precious ammunition about Rahm\\'s private advice to Mr. Obama. The story is not over.\\nLeslie H.

There were no initial\\nreports of any injuries in the blast.\\nPolice said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were in\\nthe process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.\\nSuspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after a\\nmortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.\\nThe chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. \"Lives could have been\\nlost as a result of this bombing,\" he said. \"It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or the\\ncause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debate\\nwith their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing.\"\\nEarlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.\\nPolice in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, the\\nfirst PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.\\nThe Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 March\\nlast year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in\\nAntrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.\\nOn Sunday, Republican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out\\nsurveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting the\\nareas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.\\nThe alleged presence of SRR soldiers — formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit — is controversial because British\\ntroops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas.\\nBritain heading for hung parliament\\nGuardian/ICM poll\\nTories might not win election outright, suggests new survey\\n• Comments (259)\\n• Buzz up!\\n• Digq it\\n• Julian Glover\\n• quardian.co.uk, Monday 22 February 2010 18.30 GMT\\n• Article history\\nThe Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published\\ntoday.\\nThe new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for David Cameron\\'s\\nparty.\\nThe opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues, including the economy, and in particular may be losing their\\ncampaign against Labour\\'s so-called \"death tax\". Labour leads the Tories by eight points as the party with the best policy\\non care for the elderly.\\nThe two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis, against a nine-point Tory lead when the\\nquestion was last asked in August 2009.\\nWith no more than three months to go until polling day, the Conservatives have fallen to 37%, down three on last month\\'s\\nGuardian/ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month.\\nThe party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis, last falling to 37% in February 2008.\\nAs recently as last October the Tories hit 45% in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that the\\nrace is tightening, which confirms the findings of some other recent polls.\\nMeanwhile Labour\\'s support, at 30%, is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last May, and slightly above its\\naverage for the second part of last year. However, there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Gordon Brown\\'s\\nPiers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekend\\'s reports about Brown bullying his staff.\\nLabour\\'s support is up one point on the last Guardian/ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll. Research\\nbegan last Friday and most was carried out before the serialisation of Andrew Rawnsley\\'s book in yesterday\\'s Observer,\\nwhich may have affected Labour support. Around a fifth of responses were collected on Sunday.\\nNick Clegg\\'s hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by today\\'s poll, which puts the Liberal\\nDemocrats on 20%, unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last month\\'s Guardian poll.\\nAll this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smaller\\nparties, which are on a total of 13%. Nationalists are on 5%, Ukip and the Greens on 3% each and the BNP on 2%.\\nEstimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary, but a 7% lead is at the margins of what\\nthe Tories think they need to win a majority.

Photograph: Julien Behal/PA\\nJustice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland\\'s power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic\\ndeal agreed by the main parties that \"opens a new chapter\" after decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.\\nStanding alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the\\nprime minister said the \"inspirational\" agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) was a\\nfoundation for lasting peace.\\nThe deal — finally agreed to by the DUP last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for\\npeace — comes after two weeks of round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing\\ngovernment might collapse.\\nIt will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans\\non overseeing parades.\\nBrown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of \"a new spirit of mutual co-\\noperation and respect\".\\nThe deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing\\nexecutive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including\\nthe abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.\\nA cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers are\\ndevolved from London on 12 April.\\nBrown told reporters: \"The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement\\nbelongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This is\\nthe last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of talks,\\nweeks of stalemate.\"\\nCowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making \"fair and balanced compromises\" to bridge the divisions and\\nsaid the quality of the negotiations meant that the \"devolved institutions can and will work\".\\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have\\nlaunched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal\\nwould \"absolutely\" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.\\nThe DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement \"will be more enduring because of the time spent\" in forming it.\\nReferring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 when negotiations bore fruit at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president,\\nGerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as \"yet another very good Friday\".\\nJeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP\\'s 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.\\nBut the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up\\nlegislation to change the way parades are judged.\\nA UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two\\ngovernments. \"We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,\" she said.\\nThe talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in the\\nnear 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last\\nthree years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led by\\nthe two parties.\\nThe agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont\\'s parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said the\\nbasis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it. Robinson\\nemerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the proposals. Earlier\\nin the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give unionists enough\\nconcessions.\\nRobinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal. \"We\\nhave a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in Northern\\nIreland and to the community.\\n\"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party\\'s manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we\\nbelieve this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.\"\\nHowever the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had\\nchanged their minds.\\n\"The deal hasn\\'t changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,\" Allister said.\\nThe DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election: Allister will portray the deal\\nas a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.FYI.

Bill Knapp, another senior partner and veteran of the\\nsuccessful Obama campaign, is a close adviser to the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg.\\nTory campaign insiders say they have been talking to the firm for several months after a recommendation from Mayor\\nBloomberg, who retains close links with the British Tory leadership.\\nHe was a lifelong Democrat who switched to the Republicans when he first ran for mayor.\\nThe British general election is taking on a particularly American flavor, with the prime minister also understood to be\\nseeking advice from a consultant based in the U.S. The Times of London reported that Joel Benenson, a polling and\\nstrategy adviser who worked on the team that readied Mr. Obama for the American TV debates, is helping Mr. Brown.\\nNone of the British parties has experience of leaders\\' debates and as a consequence are looking outside for help.\\nHowever, it is the decision of the Tories to reach out across the traditional ideological divide to senior Democrats that is\\nsurprising. Their party usually has looked to Republican strategists for advice, with Labour and the Democrats retaining\\nclose links.\\nMs. Dunn is a veteran of Democrat politics, beginning her career in Jimmy Carter\\'s administration and subsequently\\nworking as a consultant on many election campaigns. She returned to the White House with President Obama but left late\\nlast year when her husband, Robert Bauer, the president\\'s personal attorney, was unveiled as the incoming White House\\ncounsel.\\nMr. Knapp made television ads for the Obama campaign, has worked on five presidential campaigns and played a leading\\nrole in Mayor Bloomberg\\'s three election wins.\\nThe pre-election atmosphere in the U.K. has become increasingly fraught, with the parties trading blows on allegations of\\nbullying inside No. 10 Downing Street made in a new book on the Labour government by journalist Andrew Rawnsley.\\nIn the latest developments, the prime minister Wednesday in a GMTV breakfast television interview denied that he had\\nknown about briefings by some of his aides against Alistair Darling, his chancellor of the exchequer.\\nIn a remarkably frank interview Tuesday with Jeff Randall of Sky News, Mr. Darling said that when he remarked in the\\nsummer of 2008 that the worst global recession in 60 years was underway, No. 10 had \"unleashed the forces of hell.\"\\nMr Brown said on GMTV: \"I was never part of anything to do with this.

The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangible\\noutcomes that improve their lives.\"\\nReferring back to the Belfast agreement of 1998, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, described today\\'s agreement as\\n\"yet another good Friday.\" After reaching an agreement just before midnight on Thursday, the parties in the Northern\\nIreland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place. They will vote on 9 March to devolve policing\\nand justice powers, which will then create a justice ministry on 12 April — a key Sinn Fein demand throughout these\\nnegotiations.\\nUnder the agreement, a six-member working group, appointed by Robinson and McGuinness, will formulate a framework\\nfor handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission.\\nThe new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems, with the rights of marchers and\\nresidents taken into account. It will complete its work within three weeks, when the Northern Ireland executive will transfer\\nresponsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the group\\'s proposals.\\nAn executive working group will be set up, in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists, to improve the way the power-\\nsharing cabinet is run. Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the 2006 St Andrews\\nagreement that led to the DUP-Sinn Fein deals. These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish language\\nspeakers.\\nIan Paisley Jr, the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUP\\'s founder, described the agreement as a \"win for\\nunionism\".\\nPaisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission, which most unionists regard as biased in\\nfavour of nationalists. He added that unionist critics of the deal had \"no alternative except the imposition of joint authority\\nfrom London and Dublin\".\\nMindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice, Robinson said: \"There are some who will play\\npolitics with this agreement, but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormont\\nthat our whole community identifies with and supports.\"\\nJim Allister, the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP, said he was \"relishing the prospect\" of a general election contest\\nwith his former party. Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Sr\\'s North Antrim constituency.\\n\"In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein. They get their date for policing and justice. Secondly,\\ntheir veto can be exercised over the justice ministry. They now have working party on Irish language. North/South bodies\\nare strengthened. And finally there is a stronger north-south parliamentary forum. The DUP only get a view of parading\\nissues.\\n\"Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post,\" he said.\\nShaun Woodward, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined to\\ndestabilise the power-sharing government.\\nHe said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now \"two groups of people who were once\\nterrible rivals [who] have found a way through a very big challenge\".\\nBut the Real IRA, Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the accord at Hillsborough. In the\\npast seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations across\\nNorthern Ireland.\\nRepublican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policing\\nand justice powers are transferred to Belfast.We\\'re here next door and about to check in w cdm.FYI --\\nReid: Shelby Has Hold On All Nominees\\nFriday, Feb. 5, 2010\\nSen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effort\\nto win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state, according\\nto aides to Senate Majority Leader Reid.\\nReid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than 70 pending nominations. Reid can force a vote\\non any nomination by filing cloture.\\nBecause of the time required to vote on multiple nominations, the Senate processes most nominations by unanimous\\nconsent. Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up.\\nThe nominations will remain stalled unless Reid files cloture.\\nWhile holds are frequent, Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than is\\nnormal.\\n\"He should not be holding up 70-plus nominees for a parochial issue,\" a Democratic aide said. \"They\\'re qualified and they\\nshould be moving forward.\"\\nDisclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with Republican\\nholds on executive nominees.\\n\\'We\\'ve got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified -- nobody has a specific objection to\\nthem -- but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business,\" President Obama\\nsaid Wednesday in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats.\\nOn the Senate floor Thursday, Reid, Senate Majority Whip Durbin, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and\\nSenate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped Republicans for holds on national security nominees and judges.\\nReid, who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President George W. Bush from\\nmaking recess appointments, said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments, which the president\\ncan make when the Senate is out of session.\\n\\'What alternatives do we have?\" Reid said on the floor Thursday. \"What alternative do we have?\"\\nEarlier in the day, a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on \"several pending nominees due to\\nunaddressed national security concerns,\" including frustrations with the Air Force\\'s handling of the competition for an\\naerial refueling tanker. The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold.\\nNorthrop Grumman Corp. and EADS, the European consortium behind Airbus, and Boeing Co. are vying for the high-\\nstakes contract, potentially worth $40 billion. The Northrop/EADS team would build the planes in Mobile, Ala., but has\\nthreatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals.\\n\"Nearly 10 years after the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet, we still do not have a\\ntransparent and fair acquisition process to move forward,\" the spokesman said. \"The Department of Defense must\\nrecognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed.\"\\nDefense Secretary Gates Wednesday told House lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposals\\nsoon, and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition.\\n\"Obviously we would like to have a competition for it, and we hope that both companies will agree to participate, but we\\nwill move forward,\" Gates said. \"We have to have new tankers.\"\\nIn addition to the tanker issue, Shelby\\'s spokesman said he is frustrated that the Obama administration won\\'t build an\\nAlabama-based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices.\\nShelby secured a $45 million earmark in the FY08 omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical\\nCenter to be set up at the Army\\'s Redstone Arsenal.\\n\"Sen. Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensic\\nand technical exploitation related to IEDs, but this administration\\'s coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort,\" the\\nspokesman said. \"He has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time.\"\\nAlso Thursday, Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by Republican foot-dragging that he was considering\\nwhether Senate rules should be changed.\\n\"There\\'s a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a supermajority\\non almost everything,\" Biden said moments after swearing in Sen.

Levey February 4, 2010 Los Angeles Times\\nSpending was 17.3% of the economy last year. The share paid by the U.S. will soon exceed 50%, a study says.\\nIn a stark reminder of growing costs, the government has released a new estimate that healthcare spending grew to a\\nrecord 17.3% of the U.S. economy last year, marking the largest one-year jump in its share of the economy since the\\ngovernment started keeping such records half a century ago.\\nThe almost $2.5 trillion spent in 2009 was $134 billion more than the previous year, when healthcare consumed 16.2%\\nof the gross domestic product, according to an annual report by independent actuaries at the federal Centers for\\nMedicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, scheduled for release Thursday.\\nThe nonpartisan accounting agency also projected that as early as next year, the country could mark another milestone\\nas government picks up more than half of the nation\\'s total healthcare tab for the first time.\\nThe rise in current costs, driven in part by surging spending in Medicare and Medicaid, and the bleak projections for the\\nfuture do not take into account changes that may come if Democrats revive their healthcare overhaul legislation.\\nThe report appears likely to fuel further debate about the health bills now stalled in Congress.\\nIn the absence of change, the report raises a grim prospect for the country -- a healthcare system consuming an ever\\ngreater and potentially unsustainable share of the economy even as private health coverage lags.\\nLast year, CMS estimated that government spending on healthcare would not overtake private spending until 2016,\\ncompared with 2011 or 2012 in the current report.\\n\"The health system is hurting, and we are seeing that in these numbers,\" said Karen Davis, president of the\\nCommonwealth Fund, a leading authority on healthcare policy.\\nThe report also points up the financial cost of the so-called Great Recession and the growing pressure it is putting on\\nstate and local governments.\\nFederal and state spending on Medicaid, the nation\\'s primary health insurance program for low-income Americans,\\njumped nearly 10% in 2009, according to the report. Medicare spending, meanwhile, shot up just over 8%.\\nObama and many healthcare experts have argued that reshaping the healthcare system will ultimately make it more\\nefficient, even if overall health spending continues to increase -- a claim Republicans dispute.\\nFueled by new technology, an aging population, rising incomes and other changes, spending on medical care has been\\nconsuming a larger and larger share of the nation\\'s economy for years, jumping from about 5% of the gross domestic\\nproduct in 1960 to nearly 14% in 2000.\\nBut the recession that began in 2007 accelerated that trend, as the economy contracted while healthcare spending\\ncontinued to increase, according to CMS.\\nEven now, with the economy slowly recovering, the government expects that the growth of healthcare spending will\\noutpace the expansion of the economy. By 2020, 1 of every 5 dollars spent in the U.S. is expected to go to healthcare.\\nSome economists believe that this is not necessarily a problem, as the healthcare industry can provide good jobs and\\nimprove both health and productivity.\\nBut there is growing concern that as much as a third of the medical care delivered in this country does not help patients.\\n\"Are we getting value for the dollar? That is the question,\" said Len Nichols, health policy director at the centrist New\\nAmerica Foundation. \"If you believe that so much medical care is unnecessary, as I do, then it is criminal that we are\\nspending so much.\"\\nStuart Butler, vice president for domestic and economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that the\\nnumbers underscore the need for more aggressive action to curb spending.\\n\"The only way to do this is to simply spend less,\" Butler said, warning that the health bills being pushed on Capitol Hill do\\nthe opposite.\\nCMS officials noted that healthcare spending has been increasing even as the number of Americans without health\\ninsurance is growing, another sign of problems with the system.\\n\"With higher unemployment, people lose their jobs [and] many of them lose their healthcare coverage in the process.\\nAnd under current law, they don\\'t have much to fall back on,\" said Richard S. Foster, chief actuary.\\nFoster said that the report by his office indicated that two of the main trends driving calls for a health overhaul -- rising\\ncosts and shrinking numbers of people with health coverage -- are essentially the same as they were when the\\nhealthcare debate began last year.\\n\"Nothing much has changed in that regard,\" he said.\\nInefficiency is becoming a particularly acute problem for state and federal governments, which the report shows are\\nincreasingly supporting the nation\\'s healthcare system.\\nHalf a century ago, government accounted for just a quarter of all healthcare spending. Now, as the cost of caring for\\nelderly and poor Americans swells, government\\'s share of the total bill is fast becoming greater than that of the private\\nsector.\\nThe trend accelerated in the recession, as Washington spent billions of dollars to help states prop up Medicaid programs\\nbeing strained by the growing ranks of the unemployed and uninsured.\\nThe healthcare legislation being debated on Capitol Hill could increase the government commitment to healthcare as\\nthe federal government boosts the Medicaid program and provides billions of dollars of subsidies to low- and moderate-\\nincome Americans to help them buy insurance.\\nBut in a separate report a month ago, CMS actuaries estimated that the Senate healthcare bill would boost total\\nhealthcare spending by less than 1% over the next decade, in large part because the legislation includes initiatives to\\nmake Medicare more efficient.ANGOLANS TO VOTE IN 2012, PRESIDENT MAY EXTEND TERM(SBU) Constitutional revisions signed by President dos\\nSantos abolish direct presidential elections and would allow dos Santos to remain in power until 2022, according to\\npress.

But senior\\ndiplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will get\\nthe plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for\\nsummits at least four times a year.\\nDavid Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a \"strong voice\" on the global stage, but his\\ncomments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William Hague, who said the debate over the presidency proved\\nthat the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.\\nOfficially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair\\npersonally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the\\nformer prime minister\\'s behalf.\\n\"We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals,\" said an\\nofficial. \"There is only one candidate.\"\\nThat was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is the\\nonly contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. He emerged this week as the anti-Blair.\\nJuncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well succeed in destroying Blair\\'s chances, being viewed\\nas a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender.\\nWhile the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the\\nmeeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the\\nCopenhagen conference in December.\\nBerlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish\\nprime minister, warned that Europe\\'s credibility on global warming was at stake.\\nIn recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach\\nagreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the\\ndeveloping countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.\\nBut with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe\\nshould not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and\\nthe Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe\\'s global leadership role on climate\\nchange and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.\\nThe Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,\\nwhich is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen\\nunless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU\\'s 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the\\neastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.\\nAngela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change\\nfinancing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.\\nWhile Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates\\nfor the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high\\nrepresentative for foreign and security policy.\\nIn Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether\\nthey reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on \"almost everything\".\\nAustria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post\\nthemselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU\\nmember states — 19 out of the total 27.\\nAdding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president \"from a small\\ncountry would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.\"\\nThe Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week\\nto renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his\\ngovernment.\\nChristofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than\\nfocusing on who gets what under Lisbon.\\nSenior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be\\nconvened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose\\nManuel Barroso, to put together a new team.you?\\nComing over secure fax at 9am.RELEASE\\nIN PART\\nB6\\nsbwhoeop\\nSunday, November 29, 2009 12:24 PM\\nH\\nRe: Another memo on backdrop to this week.

Sid\\nNovember 28, 2009\\nEditorial\\nDiplomacy 101\\nWe were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. He appointed a skilled\\nspecial envoy, George Mitchell, and demanded that Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack down on anti-Israel\\nviolence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel.\\nNine months later, the president\\'s promising peace initiative has unraveled.\\nThe Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they won\\'t talk to the Israelis until they do, and\\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything.\\nMr. Obama\\'s own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may be\\nfarther off than ever.\\nPeacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than one\\nmove down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israel\\'s\\ncommitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\nsaid no.\\nMost important, they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peace\\ntalks. (We don\\'t know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his political\\nadvisers — specifically his chief of staff, Rehm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.)\\nThe idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then start\\nnegotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze, President Obama backed down.\\nMr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem, schools and synagogues and\\npermits Israel to complete 3,000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyond\\nwhat past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected the\\ncompromise.\\nWashington isn\\'t the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort, Arab states, especially\\nSaudi Arabia, refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israel\\nto fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr.\\nAbbas, who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel.\\nAll this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomatic\\nperformance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks?\\nThe president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absence\\nof a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk way\\nforward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable.Oscar, can u print this asap for hrc. Its for her 9:30am call. Thx.The Secretary\\'s Phone Call with Egyptian President Mubarak\\nBackground: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo.\\nWhile Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell\\'s request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agree\\nto proximity talks, Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israel\\nhas taken action on the \"five steps\" requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3\\nwith Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon attended in part. Egypt and\\nJordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas would\\nseek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. would\\npresent its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties\\' positions. Deputy\\nEnvoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference\\n(he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasize\\nthat it is critical that Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for negotiations that will\\nrealize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.Ok great!

Two administration sources confirmed that the\\nmeeting, which began at 5:oo pm, included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would not\\ndescribe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggests\\nthat the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates to\\nGen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same page before the president\\'s Tuesday speech.\\nBefore young officers at West Point, Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skeptical\\nnation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps and\\ntimeframes. Obama is expected to announce that he\\'ll order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about\\n30,00o troops in all, most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistan\\'s indigenous army. His speech,\\nas described in broad terms by advisers last week, will be short and serious. His challenge is to persuade Americans that\\nthe war in Afghanistan is winnable, as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believe\\nthat the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy, he\\nwould not tie troop withdrawals to any specific political developments in Afghanistan, which might run into opposition\\nfrom Democrats in Congress, who are demanding benchmarks. Nor is the President likely to impose direct conditions on\\nAfghanistan President Hamid Karzai. An official said that Obama plans to try explain the interconnection between the the\\nstability of Pakistan and the nexus of terror in Afghanistan. An explanation that the American people would accept has\\nproven elusive.\\nPermalink :: Comments (0) TrackBacks (0) :: ShareFYIAboul gheit just called to follow up on mubarak call.

Sid\\nJanuary 9,2010\\nThe First Lady, her young lover, and a scandal\\nthat could hand power to Sinn Fein\\nDavid McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences of\\nIris Robinson\\'s infidelity\\nThe mesmerising saga of the toyboy, the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulf\\nBelfast\\'s frail political settlement last night.\\nFollowing a day closeted with advisers Peter Robinson, head of the Northern Ireland government, broke his silence to\\ninsist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. His move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiry\\ninto an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party, the Democratic\\nUnionists (DUP), are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavy\\nemphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in the\\ncoming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Fein\\nbecoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting the\\npeace process in jeopardy.\\nDisclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife, Iris, who has exited from public life, led to a day-\\nlong flurry of political calls for inquiries into the Robinson family.\\nMr Robinson stands accused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactions\\nwithout declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old \"toyboy\" lover to set up a business.\\nMr Robinson said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel \"to ask me any questions he or she wishes to\\nask, and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation\".\\nInsisting he had done nothing wrong, Mr Robinson accused the BBC of broadcasting \"smears and innuendo\". Saying that\\nhe did not rule out a defamation action, he declared: \"I am being tried in the court of public opinion.\"\\nSinn Fein\\'s Martin McGuinness, who is Deputy First Minister, said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seeking\\ntalks with both Mr Robinson and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandal\\nbroke, but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr Robinson may not survive the\\nstorm.\\nMr Robinson, who has been First Minister for 18 months, is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since he\\nwas prepared to follow the Rev Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein.\\nBut the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr Robinson has resisted pressure from\\nalmost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by accepting a transfer of responsibility for policing from\\nLondon to Belfast.\\nHis reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents in\\nthe Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to the\\nfamily scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months.\\nIn recent days Mrs Robinson dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP for\\neast Belfast, a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediately\\nand stop drawing her salaries.\\nThese reflected the fact that, while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival, her behaviour is regarded\\nas inexcusable.\\nShe had been a friend of Kirk McCambley\\'s father, Billy. Before he died, he asked Mrs Robinson to look after his son. The\\nBBC programme, Spotlight, revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said she\\nsuggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council, where she is an\\nalderman.\\nShe is said to have obtained £50,000 from two property developers, to be used to set up the business. She is also said to\\nhave helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it was\\ninvestigating.\\nThe young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs Robinson\\'s one-time political adviser Selwyn Black,\\na former Methodist minister, who gave the BBC access to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs Robinson.\\nAmong those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice, a hardline critic of Mr\\nRobinson. He said the issues in the programme must be addressed \"with utter transparency and candour\".\\nUlster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey called for Mrs Robinson\\'s immediate resignation, saying: \"It is clear that Iris\\nRobinson\\'s continuing position as an MP, Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all her\\npositions with immediate effect.\"\\nHe added: \"It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party will\\nstudy the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct of\\nthe First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against the\\nFirst Minister.\"\\n* Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr Robinson\\'s future.\\nBut he said: \"It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing the\\npolitical process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas.\\n\"And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deep\\nfreeze, even some may wish to unpick, they would be extremely irresponsible, foolish and would be playing very, very\\ndangerous games.\"\\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunity\\nto clear his name.\\nBut he went on: \"I\\'m very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening, he is First Minister and the business of\\ndevolution, the business of the Executive must go on.\\n\"I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continues\\nand that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution.\" PAI will work with her on specifics and get more info to you.

It will rate high in the annals of the\\nhumanitarian aid world because of the number of victims and scale of the destruction. But the rescue operation is also\\nbecoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims. Five days after the quake hit, many places are\\nstill largely bereft of international aid.\\nNot through lack of funds, supplies or emergency experts. Those are all pouring in from dozens of countries. But most of\\nthe aid — and aid workers — seems stuck at the airport.\\nRescue teams have pulled survivors from five-star hotels, university buildings, a supermarket and the UN headquarters,\\nall in Port-au-Prince\\'s better neighbourhoods. In poor areas, where the damage appears much greater, apparently\\nforgotten victims report on Twitter that they have yet to encounter the first foreign rescuer.\\nMany aid workers are reported to have orders not to venture out without armed guards — which are not there at all, or\\nonly after long debates with the UN military command. The UN has lost a number of staff in the quake, and is not keen to\\nrisk more lives.\\nBut the Haitian people seem to scare aid workers more than Somali warlords, Darfuri Janjawid or Afghan Taleban.\\nFrightened Dutch aid workers abandoned a mission without•reaching the collapsed building where people were trapped,\\nand frightened doctors have left their patients unattended.\\nThe experience of CNN\\'s medical reporter, Dr Sanjay Gupta, is telling. In a makeshift clinic he encountered a Belgian\\nmedical team being evacuated in a UN bus. UN \"rules of engagement\" apparently stopped them providing security for the\\ndoctors. The Belgians took most of their medical supplies with them, to keep them out of the claws of robbers.\\nDr Gupta and his camera team stayed the night, monitored the abandoned patients\\' vital signs and continued intravenous\\ndrips — and they were not robbed. Some rescuers are leaning so much toward security that they will allow people to die.\\nThe media are not helping. CNN rules in the rubble. \"Outside of a military conflict, this is our biggest international\\ndeployment since the tsunami in 2004,\" according to Tony Maddox, the managing director of CNN International. So the\\nimage of the aid operation being beamed back is primarily Ameridan — and one of the big problems is the American view\\nof Haiti.\\nCNN won\\'t stop telling aid workers and the outside world about pillaging (the incidence of which — for the first four\\nfrustrating days at least — did not compare with what happened after Hurricane Katrina) and about how dangerous it is to\\ndistribute food, because of the likelihood of \"stampedes\".\\nNor is the US Government, the biggest player in the aid operation, doing anything to help to relax the atmosphere. On the\\ncontrary. When President Obama said that the US aid effort would be \"aggressive\" he meant it. The humanitarian\\noperation is not led by civilian agencies, but by the Pentagon.\\nMr Obama ordered 9,000 troops and a fleet of nuclear-powered ships to move in. Victims of the war in Congo (which has\\ncost five million lives in the past years) and of the genocide in Darfur would love so much American attention — but it is\\nHaiti\\'s fate to lay in America\\'s backyard and to have been a sore to American eyes for decades already.\\nOne, perhaps even two million Haitians already live in the United States, but more try to come. Every day dead Haitian\\nrefugees wash up on Miami\\'s sunny beaches. Haiti is a constant pain for US taxpayers who feel that the billions of dollars\\nthat have been poured in should have at least lifted the country out of its position as one of the poorest places on Earth.\\nEven when the earthquake struck, investigations were taking place into the fate of several million dollars of aid funds, sent\\nto victims of a hurricane that hit Haiti in 2008, that have disappeared.\\nFurthermore, to the horror of many godfearing Americans, voodoo is an officially recognised religion in Haiti. And, perhaps\\nabove all, Haitians are poor and black. In the view of some Americans those two add up to ... murderous gangs.\\nThe invasion of soldiers and humanitarian workers at the airport of Port-au-Prince reminds me of the American military\\ninvasion of Haiti authorised by President Clinton in 1994. I\\'d lived and worked there for almost two years as a\\ncorrespondent for Dutch radio. There were 20,000 soldiers but they were surprisingly nervous about what reception the\\nunarmed Haitians might have in store for them.\\nIt turned out to be a wave of slum dwellers streaming to the air and sea port to greet the American guests. In abundant\\nconga lines they snaked through the city, tea cosies on their heads to express just how happy they were. \"Liberte! Merci\\nBeel Cling Dong!\" they shouted. A terrified American GI, still a teenager, saw the mass of pitiful creatures approaching\\nhim, and asked me if the tea cosies were \"some kinda voodoo?\". He calmed down only when a line of BMWs and\\nMitsubishis appeared and filed past to watch the invasion.\\nWhere the soldier came from, the owners of vehicles like these are respectable citizens. In Haiti, they are likely to be the\\nones smuggling drugs and making US aid dollars disappear. The good guys in Haiti are the defenceless people in the\\nslums. For Western city dwellers, this is the world turned upside down. \"Back! Back!\" the soldier shouted, aiming his\\nweapons at the good guys.\\nThe rescue teams that stay put at the airport are one reason why we still don\\'t really know what is going on. Seventy\\nsurvivors had been pulled from the rubble so far, the International Red Cross said on Sunday. That\\'s 14 rescues per day\\nas a joint result of the 1,739 international specialised rescue workers that are there. That number would surely jump if\\nsome of the professional equipment that they brought was made available to the countless groups of local people\\ndesperately digging for victims with their bare hands, day and night.\\nLet\\'s hope that the food distributors worrying about their safety know that yesterday hundreds of people in Port-au-Prince\\ndropped to their knees praying outside a warehouse where workers for the agency Food for the Poor had announced that\\nthey would be distributing rice and beans. The crowd allowed children and the elderly to go first in line without having\\nguns aimed at them first.\\nLinda Polman\\'s War Games: The Story of War and Aid in Modern Times will be published by Penguin in AprilI will prepare for your signature.

The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech Republic will become the last EU\\ncountry to ratify the Lisbon treaty.\\nSarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at the\\nElysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, which\\nbrings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries.\\nBrown gave a hint at a press conference that Blair\\'s candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for his\\npredecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. \"Of course it may not happen and there are other\\ncandidates as well,\" he said.\\nThe prime minister\\'s remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders this\\nafternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began.\\nBrown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in the\\nEuropean parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right.\\nBrown told the meeting: \"You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be the\\npresident of the council.\"\\nBut it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero,\\nSpain\\'s centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre left\\nacross the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have to\\nwork with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Eti\\'s six-month rotating presidency on 1 January, said\\nthe European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. \"There is a preference for the high\\nrepresentative,\" he said. \"That is rather reasonable.\"\\nA senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had \"dropped Blair\" and that the centre-left in the EU\\nwas seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while the\\ncentre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn,\\nLuxembourg\\'s foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. \"lt is\\nnot about the person of Tony Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have a\\nnew treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas.

Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will be\\npleased by the strength of his successor\\'s support.\\nBrown said today: \"Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that Tony Blair would be an excellent\\ncandidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council.\\n\"His international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known to\\neverybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is in\\nBritain\\'s national interest.\"\\nguardian.co.uk Guardian News and Media Limited 2009All good — have communicated some matters to Jake.\\nRS on board.

The day she arrived,\\nextremists detonated a car bomb at a crowded market in Peshawar that killed at least 100 people. The Nation\\nnewspaper dismissed the visit as a mere \"PR exercise, but who will buy what the US is selling is difficult to imagine,\\nbeyond the already compliant government.\"\\nPolls show that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis dislike and mistrust the United States. They blame Washington\\nfor using and then abandoning them after the Soviets were driven from Afghanistan. And they resent Washington for\\npressing their government now to fight against extremists — and suspect that they will be abandoned again. The fact\\nthat many of the extremists are on Pakistan\\'s territory and threatening Pakistan\\'s government has not shifted that\\nthinking or mitigated that resentment.\\nA good part of this, of course, is the failure of Pakistan\\'s government, which has still not adequately explained that this is\\nnot just America\\'s fight. But the United States is also to blame. For eight years the Bush administration coddled the\\nPakistani Army at the expense of the rest of society.\\nMrs. Clinton challenged Pakistan\\'s government to do more to shut down Al Qaeda, but she was, rightly, determined to\\nuse this visit to also broaden the relationship.\\nInstead of just courting President Asif All Zardari and the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Mrs. Clinton also held\\ntalks with the top opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif; parried questions from an audience of deeply suspicious college\\nstudents; met with civil society leaders, including women and Pashtun elders; gave interviews to Pakistani journalists;\\nand visited religious and cultural sights.\\nShe promised to refocus American aid on the \"needs of the people\" and announced targeted commitments, including\\n$85 million for microloans for poor women to start businesses and $125 million for the first phase of an electricity\\nproject aimed at reducing blackouts and improving energy conservation.\\nThose grants are welcome but still small change when compared with a five-year, $7.5 billion — nonmilitary — aid\\npackage approved by Congress and signed into law this year. That package was supposed to demonstrate to Pakistanis\\nthat, this time, the United States is in it for the long haul. Instead, it has become another focus of popular resentment.\\nThe Army and some Pakistani news media whipped that up with disingenuous complaints that the legislation (Islamabad\\nwas consulted beforehand) compromised Pakistan\\'s sovereignty by conditioning disbursement on adequate civilian\\ncontrol of the military.\\nIf Washington is ever to enlist Pakistan as a reliable ally, it is going to have to do a much better job of explaining itself.\\nAnd it is going to have to insist that Pakistan\\'s leaders start explaining the real stakes to their citizens and the real\\nbenefits of an alliance with the United States. Mrs. Clinton\\'s trip was an important start — but only a start.Kelly, Craig A <KellyC@state.gov>\\nMonday, January 18, 2010 9:39 AM\\nH; Valenzuela, Arturo A\\nRe: Venezuela\\nMadam Secretary:\\nI will be in touch with Judith, RI et al.\\nBest,\\nCraigSee belowJeffrey L Farrow\\nFriday, October 30, 2009 2:56 PM\\nJacob J Sullivan\\nOnly Palau & Israel vote w/US in UN\\nRELEASE IN PART\\nB6\\nWed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the U.S against a\\nresolution calling for an end to the US embargo of Cuba (Israel was the other).

One of the reasons for doing daily polls is to monitor these fluctuations.\"\\nThe Tory lead of 6%, which was first reported in The Sunday Times, was maintained in YouGov\\'s polls in The Sun last\\nweek. The increase in support for Labour on Thursday and Friday, as the latest Sunday Times poll was being conducted,\\ncame as figures showed a strengthening economic recovery.\\nUnder the British parliamentary system, the prime minister remains in office after a general election until he either tenders\\nhis resignation or is defeated in a Commons no confidence vote.\\nIf the election result leaves Labour just short of an overall majority, Brown is likely to battle on, with Labour running the\\ncountry as a minority government. The party would seek to do deals with minor parties such as Ulster\\'s Democratic\\nUnionist party or, if necessary, Nick Clegg\\'s Liberal Democrats, to get its legislation through parliament.\\nIf repeated in a general election on the basis of a uniform swing in all constituencies, today\\'s poll would leave Labour just\\nnine seats short of the 326 needed for an overall majority in the new 650-seat House of Commons.\\nThe Tories would be well behind on 263 seats, with the Liberal Democrats on 41. Kellner calculated that, even allowing for\\na larger swing to the Tories in marginal seats, where the party has spent millions of pounds on campaigning, the poll was\\nconsistent with Labour being by far the largest party.\\nHe suggested that in such a scenario Labour might win 300 seats, with the Tories on 270 and the Lib Dems on 50.\\nLabour will believe it is benefiting from the upturn in the economy. For the first time in a YouGov poll since July 2007,\\nbefore the financial crisis, people trust Labour more than the Tories to run the economy.\\nYouGov, which began polling after the 2001 election, has developed a reputation for accuracy. Its final Sunday Times poll\\nin 2005 was precisely right, and it accurately predicted Boris Johnson\\'s victory in the 2008 London mayoral election and\\nthe results of last year\\'s Euro elections.\\nContact our advertising team for advertising and sponsorship in Times Online, The Times and The Sunday Times, or\\nplace your advertisement.\\nTimes Online Services: Dating I Jobs I Property Search I Used Cars I Holidays I Births, Marriages, Deaths I\\nSubscriptions E-paper\\nNews International associated websites: Milkround\\nCopyright 2010 Times Newspapers Ltd.\\nThis service is provided on Times Newspapers\\' standard Terms and Conditions.

For example, I\\nspoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only\\nuniversity represented.\\nD-We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle\\nsmaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about\\nhelping (they are in therM range).\\nE- We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME\\'s to raise $2-3M in smaller increments.\\nThey are contemplating it.\\nFinally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies\\nwho are starting to look into the market over there.\\nAnyway, I did not mean to go on and on but that\\'s where we stand and these are the potential areas to tap. We\\'ll get\\nthere.\\nOn your last Q - I too heard thatIts not like a traditional trade show/expo with specific booths. It is more subtle and the pavilion folks would negotiate\\ncreatively on what they want..\\nDepdg on amount, they get on the big wall of contributors, we show multiple scenes of NYC in the shows and displays,\\nthey can use the wonderful VIP lounge/auditorium to have NYC day or week at the Expo - the rockettes, Broadway goes\\nto China, commercial diplomacy, mtgs betwn NYC and Chinese officials, .getting SME\\'s access to China etc. We could\\nreally be creative.\\nLA, San Fran, San Antonio already in, chicago on way...\\nAs you know the general theme is \"Better Cities, Better Lives\".

Forty-one percent now say they disapprove of Mr. Obama\\'s performance as president.\\nIn last month\\'s CBS News poll, 50 percent of Americans approved of how the president was handling his job, while thirty-\\nnine percent disapproved.\\nAnalysis: The Irony Behind Obama\\'s Poll Numbers\\nMr. Obama still receives strong support from Democrats (eight in ten approve of his performance), but his approval rating\\namong Republicans is only 13 percent. More importantly, Mr. Obama\\'s approval rating among independents has declined\\n10 points in recent months — and it now stands at just 42 percent.\\nDomestic issues — and not his response to terrorist threats - appear to be driving the president\\'s approval rating\\ndownward.\\nJust 41 percent now approve of his handling of the economy, which Americans say is the nation\\'s most pressing issue.\\nForty-seven percent disapprove. The president\\'s marks on handling health care, with reforms still under debate in\\nCongress, are even lower — just 36 percent approve, while 54 percent disapprove. Both of these approval ratings are the\\nlowest of Mr. Obama\\'s presidency.\\nMeanwhile, both parties in Congress receive even lower marks than the president on handling health care. Few\\nAmericans think the reforms in Congress hit the right note on expanding coverage, lowering costs and regulating the\\nhealth insurance industry. (Read more on the health care poll results)\\n(CBS)\\nThe president receives slightly higher ratings for his handling of the war in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism than on\\ndomestic issues. Forty-six percent approve of Mr. Obama\\'s handling of Afghanistan, and 52 percent approve of how he is\\nhandling the threat of terrorism.\\nWhile some Republicans have criticized the president and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano\\'s responses\\nto the attempted Christmas Day terror attack, most Americans don\\'t share their opinion.\\nIn the poll, 57 percent of Americans approve of the way the Obama administration has responded to the attempted attack,\\nand 29 percent disapprove. Views are highly partisan — 75 percent of Democrats approve, while just 41 percent of\\nRepublicans and 55 percent of independents do.\\nMore Findings from the Poll:\\n•Fear of another terrorist attack has increased since the attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam\\non Christmas Day. Now, 26 percent think another attack on the United States within the next few months is very likely, up\\nfrom 12 percent just before the latest incident. This is the highest percentage that has felt an attack was very likely since\\nMarch 2003, just after the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\\n•While most Americans (56 percent) have at least a fair amount of confidence that the government will protect its citizens\\nfrom future attacks, just 15 percent are very confident. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, more expressed confidence.\\n•Few Americans —just 19 percent - think U.S. intelligence agencies are doing all they could to monitor the actions of\\nsuspected terrorists. Seventy-six think they could be doing more.\\n•Most Americans support conducting full body scans on travelers using a digital x-ray machine, a device some airports\\nare now using. Seventy-four percent agree these machines should be used because they provide a detailed check for\\nhidden weapons and explosives and reduce the need for physical searches. Just 20 percent think these machines should\\nnot be used because they would produce an image of a passenger\\'s naked body and are an invasion of privacy.\\n•Over half of Americans think the U.S. should continue to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison open. Thirty-two percent\\nthink it ought to be closed and the prisoners there transferred somewhere else.\\n•The American public continues to volunteer the economy and jobs as the most important problem facing the country (44\\npercent), with health care a distant second (14 percent). In the wake of the attempted terror attack on Christmas Day, the\\npercentage that cites terrorism as the most pressing issue has risen to seven percent from zero percent early last month.\\n•The public\\'s overall assessment of the condition of the national economy remains grim — 82 percent of Americans say\\nthe economy is in bad shape. Looking ahead, 31 percent of Americans think the economy is getting better, while 19\\npercent think it is getting worse. Forty-nine percent now say the economy is staying the same.Yup.

Or local staff?For your approval.FYI:\\nJan 12, 2010\\n» Mobile Home » Top Stories\\nInside the Reid eruption\\nBy Mike Allen & Glenn Thrush I 1/12/10 @ 12:19 AM EST\\nHarry Reid isn\\'t talkative. But the Senate majority leader chatted freely with the two disarmingly charming book authors\\nwho came to his office at the Capitol shortly after the 2008 election.\\nThey — and their tape recorder — were soaking in his reminiscences about the wild campaign that had turned a\\nbackbencher in his caucus into president of the United States.\\nReid wasn\\'t on guard — perhaps because he\\'d been told by his staff that the meeting would be \"off the record,\"\\naccording to a person with knowledge of the exchange.\\nAlthough Reid is a master of the Senate\\'s mysterious inside game, he\\'s often botched the outside game because of what\\none colleague calls a \"penchant for saying things without a filter.\"\\nBut Jim Manley, Reid\\'s senior communications adviser, wasn\\'t too worried as he and his boss sat down with John\\nHeilemann of New York Magazine and Mark Halperin of Time magazine — two veteran reporters who were working on\\nwhat their publisher had billed as \"a sweeping, novelistic, and ultimately definitive portrait\" of the 2008 race.\\nLike virtually every Washington political insider, Manley had a long and warm relationship with Halperin, the longtime\\npolitical director for ABC News who once set conventional wisdom in Washington with \"The Note.\"\\nMaybe Reid and Manley — thinking back to their many candid exchanges over the years — simply assumed that\\nHalperin wouldn\\'t burn him or his boss. Or maybe he expected that Halperin would check back with him on any quotes\\nhe planned to use?\\nWhatever they were thinking, they were wrong.\\nReid was talking about the reasons why, even though he had publicly professed neutrality in the vicious Democratic\\nprimaries of 2008, he had secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to challenge another member of his\\ncaucus, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid all the talk of Obama\\'s oratorical gifts, he let slip something else:\\nObama could win the White House because he was a \"light-skinned\" African-American \"with no Negro dialect, unless he\\nwanted to have one.\"\\nThe authors write in \"Game Change,\" published this weekend, that Reid had made the remark \"privately.\" They did not\\nsay he had said it to them.\\nAs a chagrined Reid telephoned political allies in the Senate and civil rights community to shore up his support this\\nweekend, he made it clear that he felt burned by the authors.\\nIn the book\\'s\"Authors\\' Note,\" they wrote: \"All of our interviews — from those with junior staffers to those with the\\ncandidates themselves — were conducted on a \\'deep background\\' basis, which means we agreed not to identify the\\nsubjects as sources in any way. We believed this was essential to eliciting the level of candor on which a book of this sort\\ndepends.\"\\nHeilemann said on MSNBC\\'s \"Morning Joe\": \"We had a very clear agreement with all those sources that our interviews\\nwould be on deep background.... Our ground rules are ... that we won\\'t identify any of our sources as the sources of the\\nmaterial. But we said to them all very clearly that if they put themselves in scenes of the book, if they were uttering\\ndialogue to people in the book in part of a scene, that we would identify them as the utterer of those words.\"\\nHalperin added: \"There\\'s no one we talked to for the book who we burned in any way, or violated any agreement with.\"\\nManley, a Capitol Hill veteran who also had worked for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, had been responsible for monitoring\\nthe interview and dealing with issues arising from it.\\nBut he didn\\'t tell anyone else in Reid\\'s inner circle about the inflammatory remarks their boss had made; because of his\\ngood relationship with the authors, he assumed that the quotes would never be made public — at least not without his\\nknowing about it first.\\nManley declined comment on this story-- and wouldn\\'t confirm if the interview took place.\\nOn Friday at 10 p.m. — half a year after the interview — The Atlantic\\'s Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reid\\'s staff with\\nquestions about a \"light-skinned\" candidate without a \"Negro dialect.\"\\nIn the second-guessing that followed, Capitol Hill veterans said there was no way that such inflammatory words from a\\nSenate majority leader would remain off the record, even if that had been the arrangement.\\nBut because Manley had not sounded an internal alarm, he and the rest of the damage-control squad were caught flat-\\nfooted by Ambinder\\'s e-mail, several people close to the situation told POLITICO.\\n\"They could have had weeks to prepare for this or to try to convince Halperin not to run it,\" said a Democrat who\\nparticipated in some of the damage control.\\nNow the staff had been blindsided with a revelation that, if mishandled, could be politically fatal. Manley and other\\naides worked until 2 a.m. Saturday to draft Reid\\'s carefully written apology, which emphasized his record on African-\\nAmerican issues.\\n\"I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words,\" the 90-word statement began.\\nLater on Saturday, Manley helped lead a counteroffensive, calling White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, a friend\\nfrom his days as communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to set up an apology call\\nbetween Reid, at home in Searchlight, Nev., and Obama back in Washington.\\nIn a stunning \"Statement by the President\" e-mailed to reporters at 3:55 p.m. Saturday, Obama said: \"Harry Reid called\\nme today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today.... As far as I\\'m concerned, the book is closed.\"\\nRelieved to have the president\\'s solid backing, Reid\\'s aides decided that their toughest challenge would be to prevent\\nany prominent African-American Democrats from attacking Reid too harshly — or calling for his resignation.\\nReid\\'s team correctly anticipated that Republicans would demand his head. Keeping that criticism from becoming a\\nbipartisan drumbeat was the key. The team calculated that as long as the attacks looked like partisan shouting, Reid\\nwould benefit.\\nAides say their boss quickly understood the danger and spent much of Saturday working a call list of about 30 prominent\\nAfrican-Americans across the country. On the calls, he apologized for his words and argued that the book\\'s main\\ntakeaway should be that he had quietly supported Obama over Clinton, long before those made his feelings public.\\nAmong those he called were the Rev. Al Sharpton; longtime civil rights leader Julian Bond; Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.),\\nchairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus; political consultant and talk-show fixture Donna Brazile; House Majority\\nWhip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.); Wade Henderson, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; and Hilary Shelton,\\ndirector of the NAACP\\'s Washington office.\\nThe extent of the damage to his already shaky reelection chances in Nevada won\\'t be known until November. But by\\nMonday, Reid believed the Washington storm was passing. From his home in New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer telephoned\\nReid in Nevada and offered to organize a letter of support from all the Democratic senators.\\nReid decided that was unnecessary. He had confidently concluded that for now, at least, he had won the inside game.Am citsHere you go:Roger.Latest below\\nWe did a series of interagency calls from 7pm - 11pm.\\nRaj going out on am shows - potus will announce him as point for coordinating our disaster assistance.\\nWe will start search and rescues teams at sunlight (w/no heavy equipment getting folks out will be hard).\\nWe have requests for hel from Irish, canadian tai\\nDavid lindewall is doing good job.\\nSee b/1.\\nCdmFyiImportance:\\nFYI\\nHighFYIFYI\\nWe have not announced the amount raised.FYIAssume the following two pieces from Dawn in Karachi reached you through other channels, but just to be sure.\\nThe first is exactly the bad story I was worried about.\\nThe second is the Administration\\'s attempt to shoot it down.\\nBottom line (another four-letter word): \"Whew!\"\\nFIRST STORY\\nTalks under way for N-deal with US: Haqqani\\nBy Zulciernain Tahir\\nMonday, 15 Feb, 2010 I 06:02 AM PST I\\nLAHORE: Pakistan\\'s Ambassador to US Husain Haqqani has said the government has started negotiating with the United\\nStates for an agreement on nuclear technology.\\n\"The US is not sceptical about our nuclear programme.

Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor to\\nformer President Bill Clinton.\\nMr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge to\\nSenator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York\\'s Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks.\\nBut Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across the\\ncountry, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. \"It\\'s not the right thing to do,\" he said,\\naccording to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.\\nA Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had been\\ntold that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White House had pressured Mr.\\nClinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand.\\nMr. Ford\\'s decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on Tuesday, came after he reached out to dozens of\\ndonors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms.\\nGillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New York\\nresident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.\\nA campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired in\\ndiscussions of \"who got there first, and who meant it the most,\" on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow a\\nRepublican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee.\\nWhat seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed,\\nwas not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there were\\nfew easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006.\\nMany spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.\\nAs he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Ford\\nemerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job at\\nMerrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist.\\nWhat seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year,\\namong Mr. Ford, 39, and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City, Washington and Los Angeles.\\nOver dinner last July at the Post House, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president of\\nHBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. \"I think you should give this serious thought,\" he said, of\\nthe Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would.\\nAfter the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the idea\\noff him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Ford\\'s best shot at\\nreaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand.\\nOver the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York\\'s wealthiest and most politically connected\\nexecutives, frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United States\\ninvestment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner, the\\nfounder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors.\\nMr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, who is also a political analyst on NBC, that money would not be a problem. \"You can raise the\\nmoney,\" he told him in December.\\nYet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch.\\n\"She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up\" was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager,\\nconveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation.\\nAs Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to be\\nshallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents there\\nwere \"scared and desperate\" about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in her\\ncity.\\nBut Ms. Gillibrand\\'s strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late January,\\nthe head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited local\\nlawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed to\\nseveral up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in New\\nYork politics than Mr. Ford.\\n\"With all due respect,\" he asked Mr. Ford, \"why do you think you have what it takes to be New York\\'s senator?\"\\nEven lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrand\\nwould be harder than it seemed.\\nRuben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, \"It\\'s\\ndifficult to make a strong case against her here.\" Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth of\\nfederal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack his\\nrelatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger he\\nencountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage.\\nAfter reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently\\npushed back, saying he had always supported a woman\\'s right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest.\\nIt did not. \"He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up,\" a friend said.\\nOne of Mr. Ford\\'s top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\\'s 2009 re-election,\\narranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr.\\nFord expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting by\\nquizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements.\\nDid he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman\\'s\\nhealth is in danger?\\nFar from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cut\\noff financing for abortions. \"You gave her a pass,\" he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose to\\nrun he hoped to return to ask for the group\\'s support. Ms. Conlin responded: \"We can never support you if you take\\nthese positions.\" Mr. Ford \"looked shocked,\" a person in the room said.\\nHis meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of the\\nStonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, he was greeted by signs that read \"Liar!\" and \"Go\\nhome snake oil Harry,\" a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it in\\nCongress.\\nA few days later, the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in, giving his\\nadvisers pause. His negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions of\\nhis record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, the data showed, but Mr. Ford\\'s chance seemed to be 50-50. \"It was not\\na slam dunk, at all,\" said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data.\\nMr. Tusk had told associates that to win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the state\\'s black vote, a tall order, but not\\ninconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week, Gov. David A. Paterson and\\nRepresentative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New York\\'s black political elite was in\\nseeming disarray, just when he needed them to be organized and unified.\\nBy Sunday, he had made up his mind not to run. He told his wife, Emily, and his father, former Representative Harold\\nFord Sr. He began to call friends the next evening, leaving many of them brief messages.\\n\"I\\'m not going to run this time,\" he said in one message. \"Thank you for your support.\"I am currently out of the office on official travel and will be checking e-mail periodically. If you need immediate\\nassistance, please call 202-647-9572.I understand from Joe that you are reviewing the key material for the human rights reports.

Something must be done.\\nTo give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency — selling renminbi\\nand buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and China\\'s exports artificially competitive — began\\naround 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overall\\nsurplus on its current account — a broad measure of the trade balance — of $46 billion.\\nToday, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International Monetary\\nFund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the most\\ndistortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed.\\nAnd it\\'s a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the world\\'s large economies are stuck in a liquidity\\ntrap — deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are\\nalready near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on these\\neconomies, which they can\\'t offset.\\nSo how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating.\\nTwice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that \"manipulate the rate of exchange between their\\ncurrency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining\\nunfair competitive advantage in international trade.\" The law\\'s intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination,\\nnot a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling\\nto do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isn\\'t taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six or\\nseven years pretending not to see the obvious.\\nWill the next report, due April 15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned.\\nIf Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? Here, we have to get past a common misunderstanding:\\nthe view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we don\\'t dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets.\\nWhat you have to ask is, What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U.S. assets? Would interest rates\\nsoar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn\\'t change: they\\'re being kept near zero by the Fed, which won\\'t raise rates\\nuntil the unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, but they\\'re mainly determined by market\\nexpectations of future short-term rates. Also, the Fed could offset any interest-rate impact of a Chinese pullback by\\nexpanding its own purchases of long-term bonds.\\nIt\\'s true that if China dumped its U.S. assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies, such as the\\neuro. But that would be a good thing for the United States, since it would make our goods more competitive and reduce\\nour trade deficit. On the other hand, it would be a bad thing for China, which would suffer large losses on its dollar\\nholdings. In short, right now America has China over a barrel, not the other way around.\\nSo we have no reason to fear China. But what should we do?\\nSome still argue that we must reason gently with China, not confront it. But we\\'ve been reasoning with China for years, as\\nits surplus ballooned, and gotten nowhere: on Sunday Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly —\\nthat his nation\\'s currency is not undervalued. (The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the\\nrenminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually\\ndoes, seeking to weaken their currencies \"just for the purposes of increasing their own exports.\"\\nBut if sweet reason won\\'t work, what\\'s the alternative? In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe\\nproblem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports, which was removed a few\\nmonths later after Germany, Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies. At this point, it\\'s hard to\\nsee China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action — except that this time the surcharge would\\nhave to be much larger, say 25 percent.\\nI don\\'t propose this turn to policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world\\'s economic\\nproblems at a time when those problems are already very severe. It\\'s time to take a stand.\\nHome\\n• World\\n• U.S.\\n• N.Y. / Region\\n• Business\\n• Technology\\n• Science\\n• Health\\n• Sports\\n• Opinion\\n• Arts\\n• Style\\n• Travel\\n• Jobs\\n• Real Estate\\n• Automobiles\\n• Back to Top\\nCopyright 2010 The New York Times Company\\n• Privacy Policy\\n• Terms of Service\\n• Search\\n• Corrections\\n• RSS\\n• First Look\\n• Help\\n• Contact Us\\n• Work for Us\\n• Site MapWe are working with Jake on some very good ideas that Bruce Jentleson has put forward, but I want to plant one idea\\nfor you to mull.See original email PAFor hrc and wjc\\nof Little Rock B6Ma\\'am — Jake tells me that you are tired of the Lamplighter story.

Such\\nannouncements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely responded,\\nlet alone violently.

Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over the\\nlast year. Though Oben-la\\'s insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate, he went a step\\ntoo far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewish\\nneighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government, let alone one headed by the Likud, could possibly agree to a freeze\\nthere. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was that\\nPalestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly.\\nObama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. Though\\nPalestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank, they now refused to sit\\ndown with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama\\'s demand for a building freeze\\nin Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations.\\nFinally, after intensive efforts, the administration produced the pathetic achievement of \"proximity talks\"—setting\\nPalestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation, to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same table\\nwith Israelis.\\nThat Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was, after ail, an amateur. But\\nhe has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo and\\nelsewhere in East Jerusalem—and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations—he\\'s ensured that the\\nPalestinians won\\'t show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy.\\nInitially, when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden\\'s\\nhumiliation and were outraged at their government\\'s incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahu\\ndeserved the administration\\'s condemnation, not because of what he did but because of what he didn\\'t do: He failed to\\nconvey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden\\'s visit, symptomatic of his chaotic style of\\ngoverning generally.\\nBut not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir,\\nthe former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement of\\nthe creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. on\\nthe Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That\\'s why he included the Labor Party into his coalition, and\\nwhy he accepted a two-state solution—an historic achievement that set the Likud, however reluctantly, within the\\nmainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Biden\\nduring his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.\\nNor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which runs the interior ministry\\nthat oversees building procedures. Shas, which supports peace talks and territorial compromise, is not a nationalist party.\\nIts interest is providing housing for its constituents, like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking international\\nincidents is not its style.\\nFinally, the very ordinariness of the building procedure—the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is considered\\nby Israelis routine—is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in the\\ninterior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit.\\nIn turning an incident into a crisis, Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking, a pretext to pick a fight\\nwith Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so.\\nAc.t,cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma\\'ariv, senior Likud officials believe that Obama\\'s goal is to topple the\\nNetanyahu government, by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition.\\nThe popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given his\\nineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions, the Israeli public is\\nnot likely to be impressed. Indeed, Israelis\\' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to an\\nIsrael Radio poll on March 16, 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis, while 20 percent\\nblame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) •\\nIn the last year, the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith—even though\\nthe Palestinian Authority media has, for example, been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews\\' historic roots\\nin Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after a\\nterrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn\\'t merit an administration rebuke.\\nObama\\'s one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of \"open season\" against Israel\\ninternationally. Indeed, the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to the\\nresumption of the peace process—as if it\\'s Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table.\\nIf the administration\\'s main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem, its main\\nstrategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office, Rehm\\nEmanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama\\'s first tent.\\ninstead, a year later, we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israel\\nnegotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as if\\nIsraelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them.\\nTo insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden\\'s plea to Israelis to consider a\\nwithdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offer\\ntwice in the last decade: first, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000, and\\nthen more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never\\nreplied.\\nThe reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine the\\nreturn of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solution\\nfrom devolving into a bi-national, one-state solution. Israel\\'s insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace.\\nTo achieve eventual peace, the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifa\\nand Jaffa and confine their people\\'s right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo their\\nclaim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people\\'s right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possible\\ndeal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority of\\nIsraelis—along with the political system—has accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side, the political system has\\nrejected it.\\nIn the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return, negotiations should not focus on a two-\\nstate solution but on more limited goals.\\nThere have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has created\\npanic within Fatah, and the result is, for the first time, genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also, the emergence of\\nSalem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still\\nlacks a power base). Finally, the West Bank economy is growing, thanks in part to Israel\\'s removal of dozens of\\nroadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends.\\nBut by focusing on building in Jerusalem, Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peace\\nprocess, Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process.\\nThe administration, according to a report in the Israeli ne\\\\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, is making an even more insidious\\naccusation against Israel. During his visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies are\\nendangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not the\\nremark was made, what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama\\'s recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian--\\nlives. As I listen to police sirens outside my window, Obama\\'s political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning into\\na third intifada over Jerusalem.\\nYossi Klein Ha/evils a senior fellow of the She/em Center in Jerusalem, and a contributing editor of The New Republic.\\nWM David Axelrod please be quiet, pease?\\nPosted By 4 \\'■ (I? \"\\nnikrionday, March 15, 2010\\nCommentary\\'s Jqr2-.)ifese,\\n,e]\\'pp.1 is reacting way out of proportion to par,. inclav morninitalk\\nThat said, she\\'s got a germ of a good point:\\nDavid Axelrod — a political operative who now seems at the center of foreign-policy formulation (more on\\nthis later) — went on the Fox, ABC, and NBC Sunday talk shows to repeat how insulted the Obami were\\nover Israeli building in Jerusalem and what an atf;:atet this was to them....\\n[I]t might have something to do with the fact that Axelrod and the Chicago pols are running foreign policy.\\nIt\\'s attack, attack, attack -- just as they do any domestic critic.\\nQuibble away with Rubin\\'s characterization of \"Chicago pols,\" but she does raise a decent question: why on God\\'s green\\nearth is the Obama equivalent of Karl Rove talking about foreign policy in public?\\nSince the tri2 from:Hag, its clear that the Obama administration has ratcheted up the rhetoric taiLvate, irLpublic, in\\npress_leaks and throupo.r.:“.!;\\':.ib.

Not bad.\\nhttp: I /www.economist.com/world/international/displavstorv.cfm?story id=15833005\\nReligion and human rights\\nThe limits of freedom and faith\\nMar 31st 2010\\nFrom The Economist print edition\\nOpponents of a bid by Muslim states to \"protect religion\" claim a small success\\nHow dare you call us blasphemers?\\nIT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and\\ncrucifixes in Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion\\'s role in the\\npublic square. But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the\\nUnited Nations. Not over the outcome, but over the slim margin of defeat.\\nOn March 25th the Human Rights Council (HRC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates its\\nWestern members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the \"defamation of\\nreligion\" as an infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference\\n(OIC), which groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions of\\nthat kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallest\\never, and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a \"defamation\" motion next time one\\ncomes around.\\nThe OIC\\'s idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies any\\nsinister intention (see article). And to some ears, the OIC\\'s effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, but\\nnothing more. (The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a congressionally\\nmandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or\\nentity: that implies that one can\\'t defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer, at least\\nphysically, alive on earth.)\\nBut critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the\\n\"defamation\" idea is worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use\\nblasphemy laws to criminalise dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be\\ncoming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against the\\nlatest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained.\\nDeeper still inside the UN\\'s bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be even\\nhigher. An \"ad hoc committee\" is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial\\ndiscrimination. Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a\\nnew convention, or a protocol to the existing one.\\nFor secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having\\nprivileged access to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad\\nenough; a UN treaty on race-plus-religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give\\nheart to theocrats.\\nAt the HRC\\'s latest discussion of this effort in March, the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to\\nplough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it would\\nbe better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism accord\\nwill resume, with a new chairman, late this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-be\\ntheocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter, because they face a real risk of being\\ndefeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman for the International Humanist\\nand Ethical Union.\\nMeanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing the\\nabuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. How fair is their point? It is an easy case to make,\\nfor example, over Pakistan.\\nSome 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country\\'s\\nindependent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that has\\nbeen handed down but never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis,\\na group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rife\\nnow than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes\\n(over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith.\\n\"The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with\\nblasphemy,\" said Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a campaign group.\\n\"But are people convicted? No. Rarely. It is used as an instrument of political and social\\ncoercion.\"\\nWhen convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan\\'s\\nparliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling\\nparty to review the blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its\\nblasphemy regime.)\\nOn Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In January 2009, in a village in Punjab province, five\\nAhmadis, a labourer and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written\\n\"Prophet Muhammad\" on the wall of a mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six months\\ntill the charge was quashed.\\nAnd last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain.\\nIt seems that his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, and\\nmany Christians had to flee. He was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. His family alleged\\ntorture; the authorities claimed suicide. There was mayhem at the funeral and the country\\'s Christians\\n(see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the \"defamation\" of faith that threatens rights but\\nmeasures that supposedly defend it.Sullivan, Jacob J <SullivanJJ@state.gov>\\nFriday, April 2, 2010 12:38 PM\\nH\\nFW: Karzai points\\nThese are the points in circulation now for comment.

Conservative\\nbacking has dropped one since then to 37% — Labour\\'s best ICM rating since December 2008 and the Tories\\' worst since\\nFebruary.\\nOn a uniform national swing, these figures could leave Labour 30 seats short of an overall majority. Even if the Tories\\nperform better than average in marginal seats — as most people expect — David Cameron would struggle to establish a\\nsecure parliamentary basis for power.\\nEither party could be left dependent on the fiber:a) Democrats, who are on 21% in the poll — down two from last week.\\nDespite that decline, the Lib Dems will be pleased by the strength of their position going into the election. The party has\\nbeen at or above 20% in seven of this year\\'s 11 ICM polls.\\nMeanwhile support for other parties, which peaked last spring in the European elections, has fallen again to just 9%.\\nAt the start of an election campaign likely to see more polling than ever before in British politics, today\\'s figures will be\\ntreated with caution unless confirmed by other surveys.\\nSome polls late last week suggested the Conservative lead had grown rather than shrunk, and research may have been\\naffected by the Easter holidays, when some voters would have been away from home. Yet the results suggest that\\nLabour\\'s chances should not be written off, and events such as the leaders\\' debates could prove decisive in the coming\\nweeks.\\nToday\\'s poll suggests 60% of people are planning to watch at least one debate, with 29% saying they plan to watch all\\nthree. Only 39% of voters said they would not watch any of them.\\nThe ICM survey also asked voters whether they might switch away from their first choice party and, if so;who they might\\nback instead.\\nLabour and Tory support is now equally solid. Overall, 71% of Labour supporters say they will definitely back Labour while\\n71% of Tories also say they will stick with their first choice party.\\nLib Dems, however, are less loyal — only 52% are sure they will end up giving Nick Clegg their vote. That leaves just over\\na quarter of each main party\\'s supporters considering backing another party.\\nThe proportion of Lib Dems and ConservatIves. saying they might vote Labour instead has doubled since ICM last asked\\nthis question earlier in the year. The ICM figures suggest the maximum potential vote for Labour and the Conservatives —\\nall their definite supporters, plus all potential switchers — is running neck and neck at 42%. The Lib Dem maximum is 28%.\\nRealistically, Labour is unlikely to beat its 2005 share of 36% and even today\\'s poll suggesting it has shed only three\\npoints since then will surprise many. Nonetheless, there is all to play for as the contest begins now.\\n•ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone on 1-3 April 2010.\\nInterviews were conducted across the country, and the results weighted to the profile of all adults. 1CM is a member of the\\nBritish Polling Council and abides by its rules.Not for public acknowledgement but, as we have said, consistent engagement at the highest levels actually works.\\nIbrahim is CEO of GEO and a major figure in Pakistani media circles.Yes, the agreement with Lavrov?

I know this is a very difficult time for everyone\\nat the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.\\nI had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you up\\nto speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.\\nBased on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we need\\nto address:\\n• Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle the\\ncommunications aspects of the drug initiative more effectively\\n• Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear, coordinated and consistent messaging on all\\naspects of the initiative\\n• Increase public awareness in Mexico about \"Merida\" ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is very\\nlittle awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USG\\n• Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide people\\nacross the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their way\\nthrough this crisis. For example, what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; what\\nprograms are available in their schools; what can they do, etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lack\\nof this sort of \"personally relevant\" information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to the\\noverall sense of things being out of control.

Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from\\nacross the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland\\'s post-1989 democratic transformation and\\nwere leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,\\nbut their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.\\nThe United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was\\none of America\\'s most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy\\nagainst an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free\\npeople. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around\\nthe world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.\\nThe Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in\\nthe face of adversity -- and I know they will pull- together in solidarity to grieve this loss.\\nMy thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.ThxSee below.

One consequence: Petraeus\\ncannot run as a Republican. At least Putin didn\\'t bring his big dogs in with him like he did with Merkel. Cheers, Sid\\nUri Avnery\\n20.3.10\\nThe Doomsday Weapon\\nIT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don\\'t learn from history are condemned\\nto repeat their mistakes.\\nSome 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against the\\nRoman Empire. In retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small and\\ninsignificant part of the world-wide empire which had just won a crushing victory against the\\nrival power — the Parthian Empire (Persia) — and put down a major rebellion in Britain. What\\nchances could the Jewish revolt have?\\nGod knows what was going on in the mind of the \"Zealots\". They eliminated the moderate\\nleaders, who warned against provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewish\\npopulation of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also relied on the Jews in Rome\\nand believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps\\nthey had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.\\nWe know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell and the\\ntemple was burned down. The last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada.\\nThe Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way, did not provoke\\nthe great powers, endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They accepted\\ncompromises, and every compromise served them as a basis for the next surge forward. They\\ncleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the sympathy of the whole\\nworld.\\nBut since the beginning of the occupation, their mind has become clouded. The cult of\\nMasada has become dominant. Divine promises once again start to play a role in public\\ndiscourse. Large parts of the public are following the new zealots.\\nThe next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against the\\nnew Rome.\\nWHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing into\\nsomething far bigger. The mouse has given birth to an elephant.\\nLately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obama\\nwith thinly veiled contempt. The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his term\\nhave dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black panther. He gave up his demand for a\\nreal settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on, he remarked that it was raining.\\nYet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice President and his\\nsenior assistants condemn the Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary of\\nState Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop all settlement activity,\\nEast Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the conflict,\\nincluding East Jerusalem, and more.\\nThe surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the Egyptian\\narmy had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all the\\nreserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations in\\nthe US were commanded to join the campaign. AIPAC blew the shofar and ordered its\\nsoldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to storm the White House.\\nIt seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obama\\nwould be defeated.\\nAnd then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.\\nTHE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.\\nDavid Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star general,\\nson of a Dutch sea captain who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazis,\\nstood out from early childhood. In West Point he was a \"distinguished cadet\", in Army\\nCommand and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander, he reaped\\nplaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served as\\nan assistant professor for international relations in the US Military Academy.\\nHe made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most problematical\\ncity in the country. He concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must win\\nover the hearts of the civilian population, acquire local allies and spend more money than\\nammunition. The locals called him King David. His success was considered so outstanding\\nthat his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.\\nHis star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soon\\nbecame the chief of the Central Command of the US army, which covers the whole Middle East\\n, except Israel and Palestine (which \"belong\" to the American command in Europe).\\nWhen such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected military\\nthinker, he has no rivals.\\nTHIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in his\\nAOR (Area Of Responsibility) — which includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran,\\nIraq and Yemen — he turned to what he called the \"root causes of instability\" in the region. The\\nlist was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\nIn his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: \"The enduring hostilities between\\nIsrael and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our\\ninterests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of\\nU.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and\\ndepth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the\\nlegitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant\\ngroups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the\\nArab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas.\"\\nNot content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefs\\nof Staff,\\nIn other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties, but a\\nsupreme national interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sided\\nsupport for the Israeli government and impose the two-state solution.\\nThe argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past.\\n(Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US would\\nchange its policy. It did not happen then.) But now this is being stated in an official document\\nwritten by the responsible American commander.\\nThe Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Its\\nspokespersons declared that Petraeus represents a narrow military approach, that he doesn\\'t\\nunderstand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is not this that made people in\\nJerusalem break out into cold sweat.\\nAS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits\\n— almost. Every American politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightest\\ndeviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to political suicide.\\nBut in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles\\' heel, the immense\\nmight of the pro-Israel lobby has a vulnerable point that, when touched, can neutralize its\\npower.\\nIt was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitive\\nintelligence agency spied for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero, a Jew who did his\\nduty to his people. But for the US intelligence community, he is a traitor who endangered the\\nlives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty, it induced the court to\\nimpose a life sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests of\\nsuccessive Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront his\\nintelligence chiefs in this matter.\\nBut the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of Sherlock\\nHolmes about the dogs that did not bark. AIPAC did not bark. The entire American Jewish\\ncommunity fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for poor Pollard.\\nWhy? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything — just anything — for the\\ngovernment of Israel. With one exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt the\\nsecurity of the United States. When the flag of security is hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans,\\nsnap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs above their\\nheads. For them, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israel\\nahead of the security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly the\\nmantra that the interests of Israel and the US are identical.\\nAnd now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. The\\npolicy of the present Israeli government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraq\\nand Afghanistan.\\nFOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that has not been\\nwidely aired. But the sword has been drawn from its scabbard - and American Jews have\\nstarted to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching earthquake.\\nThis week, Netanyahu\\'s brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He declared that\\nObama is an \"anti-Semite\". The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obama\\nis really a Muslim. They represent the radical right and its allies, who argue in speech and in\\nwriting that \"Hussein\" Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten in the coming\\ncongressional elections and in the next presidential ones.\\n(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far from\\nconvinced by these insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obama\\'s treatment of Israel is\\nfair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than Netanyahu.)\\nIf Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon - the accusation that Israel\\nputs the lives of American servicemen at risk - this would have catastrophic consequences\\nfor Israel.\\nFor the time being, this is only a shot across the bow - a warning shot fired by a warship in\\norder to induce another vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the\\n•present crisis is somehow damped down, it will inevitably flare up again and again as long as\\nthe present coalition in Israel stays in power.\\nWhen the movie \"Hurt Locker\" won its awards, the entire American public was united in its\\nconcern about the lives of its soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convinced\\nthat Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it will be a disaster for Netanyahu. And not just for\\nhim.Shaun writes me: Two polls tomorrow will show massive support in NI for HC Agreement. Also two thirds of UUP voters\\nsupport the agreement and also devolution now.

Sid\\n• Print this page\\nFrom Times Online\\nApril 14, 2010\\nTory lead narrows amid huge voter\\ndisenchantment, Times poll finds\\nolmage :1 of 20,\\nPeter Riddell\\nThe general election race is tightening, according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep public\\ndisenchantment with the campaign so far.\\nThe poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than either\\na Tory or a Labour outright victory.\\nConservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 per\\ncent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.\\nThe polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way. and these shifts are within the margin of error of the average.\\nWith other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its manifesto\\nlaunch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.\\nIf the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks\\' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes,\\nLabour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This\\nwould point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.\\nThe latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one),\\nagainst 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than\\nthe Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they want\\nLabour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government.\\nThe poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past\\nweek. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with a\\nweek ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be.\\nThe public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely honest\\nabout their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about cutting the\\ndeficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the extent to which\\nthey can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest.\\nVoters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing\\nthe increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals\\nand the police (the Tories, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign workers\\nemployed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour).\\nIn only one case, the £150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party making\\nthe proposal.\\nIn most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people\\'s votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreign\\nworkers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc.\\nMore than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say \"none of the parties\", or \"don\\'t know\", when asked\\nwhich party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and 18 per\\ncent Labour.\\nJust over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders\\' debate on Thursday evening. Men and\\nmiddle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect David\\nCameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57 per\\ncent) expect their leader to win.\\nTwo fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not sure\\nthat it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to the\\nTories.\\nPopulus interviewed a random sample of 1,525 adult voters on April 12 to 13.

The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entire\\npower-sharing executive is dysfunctional.\\nSir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powers\\nunless it obtained concessions on education — specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at 11.\\nFollowing the aborted meeting today, the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinson,\\nthe first minister, who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party. The UUP claimed it had been ejected from the\\ndeputy first minister\\'s office.\\nA UUP spokesman said: \"An ill-tempered deputy first minister attempted to aggressively lecture the Ulster Unionist party\\non policing and justice. He ridiculously accused us of being an anti-agreement party. Our delegation robustly reminded the\\ndeputy first minister that we were the party which brought power-sharing government to Stormont.\\n\"Quite clearly dissent and disagreement are unacceptable to Sinn Fein — unfortunately for Mr McGuinness, a party voting\\nagainst a motion with which it disagrees is basic, normal democratic politics.\"\\nThe spokesman added that McGuinness\\'s \"angry and aggressive attempt to lecture\" the UUP was \"wholly unacceptable\".\\n\"When challenged on his tone, the meeting broke down. The UUP will not take lectures on our commitment to devolution\\nfrom Martin McGuinness.\\n\"If this is how Sinn Fein understands power-sharing, then it is small wonder that the [Northern Ireland] executive is\\ndysfunctional.\"\\nIf the DUP and Sinn Fein press ahead with the vote it is highly likely that the leader of the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance\\nparty, David Ford, will become the first justice minister for Northern Ireland.\\nThe SDLP will back the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly tomorrow. However the nationalist party is\\nangry that it is not being offered the justice ministry. Under the rules governing the hand-out of ministries in the power-\\nsharing government the SDLP are officially entitled to choose the next ministry.\\nThe party opposes the appointment of Ford as justice minister but will still support the transfer of these powers as they\\nwant to be seen to continue to back the power-sharing arrangement.\\nUS Congress warns Cameron over danger of\\nfailed Ulster police deal\\nYes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month\\n• Nicholas Watt, chief political correspondent\\n• guardian.co.uk, Sunday 7 March 2010 22.12 GMT\\n• Article history\\nUS secretary of state Hillary Clinton is said to be concerned at Cameron\\'s apparent failure to exert pressure on his UUP\\npartners.

Democratic and Republican leaders\\nwill both be watching to see whether all mainstream political parties endorse the final stage in the implementation of the\\nGood Friday Agreement: the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.\\nSir Reg Empey, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, is meeting his executive tonight to decide whether to vote yes.\\nEmpey has severe doubts about the deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party. This would see policing\\nand criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month — a key nationalist demand — in return for the long-standing\\nunionist demand for a review of the way in which contentious parades are run.\\nIntense pressure is being placed on Empey to fall into line. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state who has taken a keen\\ninterest in Northern Ireland since the peace process was launched in the early days of her husband\\'s presidency, spent\\n15 minutes talking to Empey by phone, according to BBC Northern Ireland.\\nBut transatlantic pressure has also been brought to bear on the other side of the Irish Sea. I reported this morning that a\\ngroup of bipartisan US Congressmen have written to David Cameron asking him to use his influence with the UUP, which\\nrecently formed an electoral pact with the Tories, to vote yes.\\nThe unease among the US Congress members is shared by Hillary Clinton. She is said to believe that Cameron would be\\nwell advised to follow the example of John Major, who was respected as an impartial referee.\\nThe concerns in the US will raise questions about claims made in private recently by William Hague. The shadow foreign\\nsecretary is saying that, despite their political differences, he is forging a strong bond with Clinton.\\nBut all sides need to be careful. The Tories, who support the deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP, believe that ministers\\nneed to be careful about frightening the UUP with too much political pressure. The government was this morning\\ntrumpeting a poll, commissioned by them, which showed overwhelming support among UUP voters for a yes vote. But, as\\nSlugger O\\'Toole notes, there is some debate about the methodology.\\n\"It almost feels like the government want the UUP to vote no so they can draw one of Gordon Brown\\'s beloved dividing\\nlines and say we are to blame for it all going wrong,\" one Tory tells me.FYI, see below.

The pact has prompted fears in\\nWashington that Cameron may abandon the even-handed approach to Northern Ireland adopted by John Major in the\\nearly years of the peace process.\\nThe Guardian understands that the White House is so concerned that the US economic envoy to Northern Ireland, Declan\\nKelly, persuaded Bush to intervene. The former president telephoned Cameron to ask him to use his influence to\\npersuade Empey to vote for the deal.\\n\"There was a feeling that a conservative to conservative conversation was the right way to go about this,\" said one source\\nfamiliar with the transatlantic negotiations. \"This conversation was borne out of the concern that Empey is holding out.\"\\nAnother source familiar with the contact said: \"This is the most active thing George W Bush has done in his post-\\npresidency period. He has been incredibly restrained and diplomatic since leaving the White House. He has maintained\\nradio silence.\"\\nOne source familiar with thinking on Northern Ireland on both sides of the Atlantic added: \"The fact that George W Bush\\nhas decided to intervene is really significant. He was interested in the peace process as president and appointed an\\nenvoy. It is a general sign of how concerned people are in the US about what David Cameron is up to.\"\\nA Tory source said: \"George Bush did have a conversation with David Cameron. It was a positive conversation. David\\nunderlined his commitment to the agreement and said we are doing all we can to support it. But he said that we cannot\\nforce Sir Reg to vote for it. George Bush thanked David and said, \\'I can see you are engaged.\"\\nThe disclosure of Bush\\'s intervention came as Empey met the executive of his party tonight to decide whether to endorse\\nthe deal brokered last month at Hillsborough Castle between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists that would see\\npolicing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month.\\nB6\\nThe UUP leader, who is minister for employment and learning in the four-party power sharing executive, believes it is\\nfoolish to devolve the final set of powers while the coalition is struggling to function. In a sign of Empey\\'s unease about\\nendorsing the deal, a meeting between the UUP and the Sinn Fein deputy first minster, Martin McGuinness, broke up\\nafter just three minutes tonight.\\nThe White House and political leaders across the spectrum in the US have been watching developments with care. Hillary\\nClinton, the US secretary of state, today pleaded with Empey in a 15-minute telephone call to support the deal.\\nA group of US Congress members wrote to Cameron last month to issue a stark warning that dissident terrorists will be\\n\"emboldened\" to intensify their attacks if he fails to persuade the Tories\\' partners to endorse the final stage of the peace\\nprocess.FYISullivan, Jacob J <Sullivanii@state.gov>\\nTuesday, March 9, 2010 7:40 AM\\nH\\nRe: Libya\\nB5\\nI was thinking the same thing after Jeff\\'s latest missive last night.Rogeryes, within about 15 min.

It allows them to fuzz up the hard parts of a negotiation -- the \"final status\" issues, as they\\'re\\noften called -- and save them for later, when the parties are more amenable to pressure.\\nThis devotion to \"constructive ambiguity\" has been a hallmark of U.S. peacemaking on the Palestinian-Israeli issue for 40\\nyears. Rather than state the unpalatable concessions that most analysts recognize will be required for any viable\\nsettlement -- that Israelis must share sovereignty in Jerusalem and that Palestinians must give up the \"right of return\" to\\nIsrael -- successive U.S. administrations have tried to defer these unmentionables until later.\\nBut the fog machine blew apart this month, when the isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du\\n..ripq. visit ily__Vde President\\nBiden that Israel would build 1,600 more housipg priits in ,lerusal.\\nerp. The Obama administration was upset, to put it\\nmildly: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the housing announcement a \"deeply negative signal\" about U.S.-Israeli\\nrelations and \"an insult.\"\\nIn the ensuing hubbub over the \"crisis\" in U.S.-Israeli relations, there have been frantic attempts to pretend it was all a\\nmisunderstanding and pull the cloak of ambiguity back over the peace process. But that\\'s a mistake.\\nThe East Jerusalem move wasn\\'t an accident but an emphatic public statement of the Israeli right\\'s rejection of\\nconcessions on Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been trying to play along with U.S. requests to fuzz\\nthe issue by avoiding provocative actions on Jerusalem. But the right-wing Shas party, which controls the Interior Ministry,\\nbasically called his bluff.\\n\"Freezing building in East Jerusalem is one of those things we cannot do,\" said Dore Gold, a right-wing former Israeli\\nambassador to the United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister and a settler himself, responded:\\n\"Can you imagine if they told Jews in New York they could not build or buy in Queens?\"\\nSo what should the administration do, now that the Israeli right has put Jerusalem squarely on the table despite the best\\nefforts of the ambiguity-addicted diplomats?\\nThe administration\\'s best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago, which is to state clearly the basic principles that\\nmust frame these negotiations. Those guidelines have been articulated well by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national\\nsecurity adviser: real sharing of Jerusalem; no right of return for the Palestinians; a return to the 1967 borders, with mutual\\nadjustments to allow for big Israeli settlement blocks; and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation for the past\\nfour decades has converged toward those parameters.\\nThe Obama administration debated whether to issue such a statement of principles a year ago, when it began its\\npeacemaking effort. Launching negotiations with this \"big bang\" made sense to some officials, including Gen. Jim Jones,\\nthe national security adviser, But George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy, argued that based on his experience in the\\nNorthern Ireland peace talks, it was better to let the parties haggle before the United States stepped in with bridging\\nproposals.\\nRather than stating U.S. negotiating principles at the outset, the Obama team decided instead to push Netanyahu on\\nsettlements. The administration picked this fight in the flush of President Obama\\'s first months in office, confident that he\\nwas so strong and Netanyahu so weak that if it came to a showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coolly\\nbided his time, dickering about procedural issues while Obama got weaker politically by the month. Netanyahu finally\\nagreed in November to a temporary moratorium on new settlements -- but it excluded Jerusalem. The administration\\nshould have seen what was coming.\\nIn retrospect, it seems clear that the step-by-step approach was a mistake: Constructive ambiguity, in this case, proved\\ndestructive. It allowed the Israeli right wing to perpetuate the idea that it could have it all -- obtain a peace deal without\\nmaking concessions on Jerusalem. And it allowed Netanyahu to continue his straddle.\\nJerusalem is the hardest issue of all in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, and for that reason, would-be peacemakers\\nhave wanted to save it for last. But this month\\'s crisis makes that strategic waffling impossible. Thanks to the Israeli right,\\nthe Jerusalem issue is joined.\\nWhat\\'s needed now is for Obama to announce that when negotiations begin, the United States will state its views about\\nJerusalem and other key issues -- sketching the outlines of the deal that most Israelis and Palestinians want. If Netanyahu\\nrefuses to play, then we have a real crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations.\\ndavidignatius_@washpost.corn\\nPost a Comment\\nView all comments that have been posted about this article.\\nComments that include profanity or personal attacks or other inappropriate comments or material will be removed from the\\nsite.

Photograph: Peter Muhly/AFP/Getty Images\\nThe final part of the Northern Ireland devolution deal was put in place today, giving the province its first justice minister\\nsince the Troubles erupted four decades ago.\\nNationalists and unionists in the Stormont parliament voted together to create the new justice ministry, completing the last\\nact of the Good Friday agreement.\\nBut there was discord inside the Stormont parliament after the Conservatives\\' allies in Northern Ireland, the Ulster\\nUnionists, and their 18-strong assembly team, voted against the move.\\nDespite an 11th hour intervention by David Cameron imploring the UUP to vote yes, the party refused to back the historic\\nmeasure.\\nThe party\\'s stance puts Cameron in a difficult position: he is in favour of the devolution of justice to Belfast, but his\\nelectoral pact with the UUP risks exposing him to criticism that a Conservative government could not claim to be an\\n\"honest broker\" when there are disagreements between the parties at Stormont.\\nToday\\'s vote came just before 5pm, when 88 assembly members from Sinn Fein and the DUP joined the SDLP and\\nsmaller parties to back the transfer of policing and judicial powers to Belfast.\\nBut the UUP resisted pressure — from, among others, former US president George Bush — to support the measure.\\nSpeaking on the assembly floor, Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, said his party had voted no \"as a democratic political\\nto a friend\\nhare\\nend\\nIL\\ni\\nr•\\nontact us\\ner I smaller\\nparty pledged to making power-sharing work in an inclusive manner for all the people of Northern Ireland, and we exercise\\nour rights refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks.\"\\nThe deputy first minister, Sinn Fein\\'s Martin McGuinness, earlier denounced the UUP stance, claiming it was intended to\\nembarrass the DUP.\\n\"The UUP declared last night that they will not support this resolution,\" McGuinness told the assembly.\\n\"That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons.\"\\nIn a statement after the vote, Gordon Brown praised the parties which backed the deal. \"Today the politics of progress\\nhave finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland,\" the prime minister said. \"The completion of devolution,\\nsupported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends the most\\npowerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail.\\n\"The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.\"\\nThe Conservatives welcomed the vote, without mentioning the UUP\\'s rejection of the move. A Tory spokesman said: \"We\\nwelcome the fact that devolution of policing and justice is going to happen. We wanted all four parties to be involved and\\nfor it to be decided by local politicians.\"\\nBut the Liberal Democrats called on Cameron to \"clarify the position of his Tory-UUP alliance on the devolution of policing\\nand justice powers\".\\nAlistair Carmichael, their spokesman on Northern Ireland, said: \"With the UUP saying one thing, and the Tories saying the\\ncomplete opposite, voters will struggle to understand what exactly joint Tory-UUP candidates stand for. What we\\'re seeing\\nis the Tories in complete disarray. When it takes George Bush to step in as the voice of reason, it\\'s clear that David\\nCameron has dug himself a very big hole.\"\\nCarmichael added: \"This raises serious questions about David Cameron\\'s judgment. If he can\\'t manage to steer a straight\\ncourse in opposition, how on earth would he cope as prime minister?\"\\nEarlier there was acrimony in the Great Hall at Stormont when a victims\\' campaigner attempted to serve a civil writ against\\nMcGuinness.\\nWillie Frazer of the group Families Acting for Innocent Relatives threw the legal document in McGuinness\\'s direction after\\nthe deputy first minister refused to take it off him. Frazer is taking a civil action in Belfast high court against the Sinn Fein\\nMP because he alleges McGuinness directed the IRA\\'s campaign during the Troubles. The south Armagh unionist\\'s father\\nwas shot dead by the IRA.\\nThe FAIR spokesman said he had chosen yesterday because the DUP \"had betrayed me and other victims\" by agreeing\\nto devolve policing and justice powers. Frazer predicted that Sinn Fein would exercise a major influence over the police\\nand judiciary even though the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance party leader, David Ford, will be the first justice minister.\\nFrazer said: \"I am very disappointed in the DUP because for years they said the things victims wanted to hear and now\\nthey have done a complete somersault. All along they told me that Sinn Fein would never get their hands on policing and\\njustice but they have a say. Mr Ford is answerable to the executive and that means the deputy first minister, Martin\\nMcGuinness. That is why the only action left to me is a civil action. I feel very let down by a number of DUP people.\"\\nThe DUP will suffer at the polls for this U-turn, Frazer predicted.\\nrintable version\\nEmail\\nClose\\nRecipient\\'s email address\\nYour first name\\nYour surname\\nAdd a note (optional)\\n[Send]\\nYour IP address will be logged\\nShare\\nClose\\n• Digq\\n• reddit\\n• Google Bookmarks\\n• Twitter\\n• delicious\\n• StumbleUpon\\n• Newsvine\\n• livejournal\\n• Facebook\\n• Mixx it!\\nContact us\\nClose\\n• Contact the Politics editor\\npolitics.editorA\\nguardianunlimited.co.uk\\n• Report errors or inaccuracies: userhelpguardian.co.uk\\n• Letters for publication should be sent to: lettersguardian.co.uk\\n• If you need help using the site: userhelpguardian.co.uk\\n• Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard:\\n+44 (0)20 3353 2000\\no Advertising guide\\no License/buy our content\\nPolitics\\n• Northern Irish politics •\\n• Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) •\\n• Conservatives\\nUK news\\n• Northern Ireland •\\n• Police\\nMore news\\n• More on this story\\n• We will not be bullied, says UUP leader\\n• Henry McDonald: Americans hold the key\\n• UUP-Conservative alliance: a risky strategy\\n• Nicholas Watt: Cameron tempts Bush out of retirement\\n• Editorial: The Tories and the peace process\\nRelated\\n9 Mar 2010\\nWe will not be bullied, says UUP leader Sir Reg Empey\\n8 Mar 2010\\nrintable version\\nUlster Unionist party policing meeting with Martin McGuinness breaks down after three minutes\\n13 May 2009\\nUlster Unionist MP will not stand as Tory candidate\\n6 Apr 2009\\nNorthern Ireland first minister claims Tories and UUP colluding over expenses stories\\nEmail\\nClose\\nRecipient\\'s email address\\nYour first name\\nYour surname\\nAdd a note (optional)\\n[Send]\\nYour IP address will be logged\\nShare\\nClose\\n• Digq\\n• redd it\\n• Gooqle Bookmarks\\n• Twitter\\n• delicious\\n• StumbleUpon\\n• Newsvine\\n• livejournal\\n• Facebook\\n• Mixx it!\\nContact us\\nClose\\n• Contact the Politics editor\\npolitics.editora\\nquardianunlimited.co.uk\\n• Report errors or inaccuracies: userhelpaguardian.co.uk\\n• Letters for publication should be sent to: lettersaguardian.co.uk\\n• If you need help using the site: userhelp(a,guardian.co.uk\\n• Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard:\\n+44 (0)20 3353 2000\\n•\\no Advertising guide\\no License/buy our content\\nAbout this article\\nClose\\nNorthern Ireland: UUP rejects Tory plea and\\nvotes against devolution of policing powers\\nThis article was published on quardian.co.uk at 17.37 GMT on Tuesday 9 March 2010.

SANGER and THOM SHANKER\\nPublished: April 18, 2010\\nWASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White\\nHouse officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran\\'s steady progress\\ntoward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document.\\nSeveral officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obama\\'s national security adviser, Gen.\\nJames L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to\\ndevelop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be\\nconsidered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.\\nOfficials familiar with the memo\\'s contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not\\nsections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies.\\nOne senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,\\ndescribed the document as \"a wake-up call.\" But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months\\nthey had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran\\'s nuclear program.\\nIn an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: \"On Iran, we are doing\\nwhat we said we were going to do. The fact that we don\\'t announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see\\ndoesn\\'t mean we don\\'t have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do.\"\\nBut in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran\\nchoose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it\\nneeds for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.\\nIn that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a\\n\"virtual\" nuclear weapons state.\\nAccording to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain\\nIran\\'s power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be\\nobtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely\\npossibility.\\nMr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the\\ndocument, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, \"The secretary believes the president and his national security\\nteam have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of\\ncontingencies with respect to Iran.\"\\nPressed on the administration\\'s ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow.\\nIran\\'s program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was\\na line Iran would not be permitted to cross.\\nThe official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not \"acquire a nuclear capability,\" a step Tehran\\ncould get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. \"That includes the ability to have a breakout,\" he said,\\nusing the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its\\ntechnology to build a small arsenal.\\nNearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a\\ndifference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. \"I\\'m not going to parse that right\\nnow,\" he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,\\nas he said, \"became a self-professed nuclear state.\"\\nMr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps\\ntoward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program \"Meet the Press,\" he said: \"If their policy is to go to\\nthe threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don\\'t actually know\\nhow you would verify that.\" But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, \"It\\'s going slow -\\nslower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction.\"\\nMr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration\\'s strategy, and he has been known over his career to\\nissue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.\\nSome officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United\\nStates was not adequately prepared.\\nHe wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic\\nengagement.\\nBoth that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that\\nthe revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain\\nnear Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in\\nwhat proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a\\nmedical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.\\nMr. Gates\\'s memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White\\nHouse did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,\\njust before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official\\n\"chairman\\'s guidance\" to his staff saying that while any military option would have \"limited results\" against Iran\\'s\\nnuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.\\n\"Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready,\" the admiral wrote.\\nAdministration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under\\nway. So did General Jones. \"The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be\\nprepared for every possible contingency,\" he said in the interview. \"That is what we have done from day one, while\\nsuccessfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations.\"\\nAt the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense\\nIntelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military\\'s\\nmost experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear\\nweapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.\\nThe administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, including\\nplacing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly(wanted to give you some brief observations from my trip to Lithuania. First of all, their friendship with the US and\\nrespect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted\\nfor me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he\\'s\\nhoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for\\nEastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the\\nPresident and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,\\ndespite a tough economy, have done everything we\\'ve asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting\\nwith the Speaker and top women members of the parl\\'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.\\nOne of the women was at the Vienna W conf and said she\\'s in politics today because of you. Another read about safe\\nbirthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more\\nopportunities to work together.\\nI came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude\\nfor our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.\\nThe meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an\\nimportant time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several\\nyears.\\nWe had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland W conf.\\n(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for\\nfuture concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD\\nministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive\\nresponse for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender\\ninstitute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.\\nThe Dutch minister who came\\nsaid the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.\\nLastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief\\nwas palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting. She told me that they lost so many\\nof their top leaders across all sectors of society, incl several top women leaders. Jolenta\\' foundation has been very active\\nin advancing women\\'s progress in Poland as well as working in other countries.sbwhoeop\\nTuesday, March 9, 2010 10:45 PM\\nH: FYI, a little collaboration in the spirit of postpartisanship.

Empey, the\\nminister for employment and learning, said: \"We exercise our rights, refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which\\nwe have been subjected in recent weeks.\"\\nThe UUP hit out after facing intense pressure from London and the US to fall in behind David Cameron, who has backed\\ndevolution of the criminal justice system. Gordon Brown phoned Empey shortly before today\\'s vote, while former US\\npresident George Bush pleaded with Cameron last week to persuade the UUP to support the deal.\\nEmpey\\'s unionist rivals, the DUP, who have overtaken the UUP in recent years, focused on what could happen after the\\nvote. The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, who managed to persuade all but one of his 36 assembly members to back the\\ndevolution deal, said: \"The move is about completing and maintaining devolution, it is about whether we move forward\\ntogether as a society.\"\\nThe vote secures an extra £800m for policing and justice that Brown promised the assembly if they backed the transfer. It\\nalso adds an extra 1,200 police officers. The prime minister praised the main parties for reaching the deal on an issue that\\nalmost broke the power-sharing government.\\nHe said: \"Today the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland. The completion of\\ndevolution, supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends\\nthe most powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail. The courage\\nand leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.\"\\nThe vote was also praised tonight by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state. She\\nsaid: \"I commend the Northern Ireland Assembly for its affirmation of the\\nHillsborough Agreement and its endorsement of the devolution of policing and\\njustice, an important step in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future for all of the\\npeople of Northern Ireland for generations to come.\"\\nIrish president Mary McAleese also hailed the move. \"Today\\'s vote in the Northern Ireland assembly represents an\\neloquent statement of confidence in the political institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement,\" she said.\\nMatt Baggott, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, welcomed the vote as a step forward. \"Devolution\\nwill strengthen our service. It will help to ensure communities receive the policing service that not only they deserve, but\\nthat we are committed to delivering.\\n\"The financial package is also welcomed ... it will help us deal with those who are living in the darkness of the past and\\nwho have tried to disrupt this process and the lives of our community.\"\\nBut there was discord inside Stormont after the UUP and their 17-strong assembly team voted against the move.\\nMartin McGuinness, Sinn Fein\\'s deputy first minister, denounced the UUP stance, claiming they were doing it to\\nembarrass the DUP. \"The UUP declared last night [Monday] that they will not support this resolution,\" McGuinness told\\nthe assembly. \"That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political\\nreasons.\" He stressed that no single party could control the justice department.\\nThe UUP no-vote will put pressure on the Tories, who will campaign with their allies in the general election, having taken\\nopposing sides on the biggest vote since the DUP and Sinn Fein started sharing power in 2007.\\nCameron insisted that the Tories had played a constructive role, saying he would maintain his alliance with the UUP. \"We\\nwant to move Northern Ireland politics forward — to focus on the issues that affect people in their everyday lives — rather\\nthan remaining stuck in the past. That is why we remain totally committed to bringing national, mainstream UK politics to\\nNorthern Ireland and to ending its semi-detached political status.\"\\nCameron\\'s remarks were designed, in part, to reassure the White House, which fears a UUP no-vote could harden\\nunionist opinion against power-sharing.\\nHardline Unionists turned on the DUP tonight. Jim Allister, the former DUP MEP, who now leads the breakaway\\nTraditional Unionist Voice, claimed his former party had \"rolled over in triple somersaults for Sinn Fein\". He also\\nsuggested the new justice minister would be a \"pointless puppet keeping the seat warm for Sinn Fein\". Prior to the vote\\nthe widow of the first Police Service of Northern Ireland officer to be murdered by dissident republicans urged all parties to\\nback the devolution of policing and justice powers. Kate Carroll, whose husband, Stephen, was killed by a Continuity IRA\\nsniper, said in an appeal to the UUP: \"It is heartbreaking that I have to get on this morning to please ask the politicians to\\nget on with their job.\"FYI — I\\'m sure you saw.\\ncdmFYI.

As the only woman among the \"Big Six\" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a\\nmovement that changed our country forever. She organized the \"Wednesdays in Mississippi\" meetings that brought\\nblack and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what\\nshe knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know\\nDr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early\\ndays at the Children\\'s Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.\\nFrom the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust\\nof Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her\\naccomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the\\ncolor of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should\\nhave the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for\\nthe life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height\\'s\\nfamily today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to\\nhonor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom\\ngates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.Basically if they can get their teams in from brussels tomorrow morning (a day before nato starts), its moving forward.\\nWe should know approx 6am our time.

I\\'d like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a\\ntrilogy. Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions\\nmust be seen through a prism of human survival and why the conditions of people\\'s lives influence everything from\\neconomic development to political stability and more. This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further\\nunderscore our elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy.

KRISTOF\\nJUBA, Sudan\\nUntil he reached the White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure on\\nSudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere.\\nYet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Western\\nmonitors, Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month\\'s Sudanese elections to be deeply\\nflawed - yet Mr. Obama\\'s special envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended the elections, saying\\nthey would be \"as free and as fair as possible.\" The White House showed only a hint more backbone with a hurried\\nreference this week to \"an essential step\" with \"serious irregularities.\"\\nPresident Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against\\nhumanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he was\\nquoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region: \"Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is against\\nour will.\"\\nMemo to Mr. Obama: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America is\\nin his pocket, it\\'s time to review your policy.\\nPerhaps the Obama administration caved because it considers a flawed election better than no election. That\\'s a\\nreasonable view, one I share. It\\'s conceivable that Mr. Bashir could have won a quasi-fair election - oil revenues have\\nmanifestly raised the standard of living in parts of Sudan - and the campaigning did create space for sharp criticism of\\nthe government.\\nIt\\'s also true that Sudan has been behaving better in some respects.\\nThe death toll in Darfur is hugely reduced, and the government is negotiating with rebel groups there. The Sudanese\\ngovernment gave me a visa and travel permits to Darfur, allowing me to travel legally and freely.\\nThe real game isn\\'t, in fact, Darfur or the elections but the maneuvering for a possible new civil war. The last north-south\\ncivil war in Sudan ended with a fragile peace in 2005, after some two million deaths. The peace agreement provided for\\na referendum, scheduled to take place in January, in which southern Sudanese will decide whether to secede. They are\\nexpected to vote overwhelmingly to form a separate country.\\nThen the question becomes: will the north allow South Sudan to separate? The south holds the great majority of the\\ncountry\\'s oil, and it\\'s difficult to see President Bashir allowing oil fields to walk away.\\n\"If the result of the referendum is independence, there is going to be war - complete war,\" predicts Mudawi Ibrahim\\nAdam, one of Sudan\\'s most outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions that America\\'s willingness to turn a blind\\neye to election-rigging here increases the risk that Mr. Bashir will feel that he can get away with war.\\n\"They\\'re very naïve in Washington,\" Mr. Mudawi said. \"They don\\'t understand what is going on.\"\\nOn the other hand, a senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told me unequivocally in Khartoum, the\\nnation\\'s capital, that Sudan will honor the referendum results. And it\\'s certainly plausible that north and south will\\nmuddle through and avoid war, for both sides are exhausted by years of fighting.\\nHere in Juba, the South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, who fled the civil war in 1994 after a militia from the north\\nattacked her village to kill, loot, rape and burn. Her father and many relatives were killed, but she escaped and made her\\nway to Kenya - and eventually resettled as a refugee in California. She now lives in Olathe, Kan., and she had returned\\nfor the first time to Sudan to visit a mother and sisters she had last seen when she was a little girl.\\nMs. Wol, every bit the well-dressed American, let me tag along for her journey back to her village of Nyamlell, 400 miles\\nnorthwest of Juba.\\nThe trip ended by a thatch-roof hut that belonged to her mother, who didn\\'t know she was coming - so no one was\\nhome. Ms. Wol was crushed.\\nThen there was a scream and a woman came running. It was Ms. Wol\\'s mother, somehow recognizing her, and they flew\\ninto each other\\'s arms.\\nTo me, it felt like a peace dividend.\\nYet that peace is fragile, and Ms. Wol knows that the northern forces may come back to pillage again. \"I don\\'t want\\nwar,\" she said, \"but I don\\'t think they will allow us to separate.\"\\nMy own hunch is that the north hasn\\'t entirely decided what to do, and that strong international pressure can reduce\\nthe risk of another savage war. If President Obama is ever going to find his voice on Sudan, it had better be soon.Pis print for HRC to read this weekend.\\nShe can sign here on Monday and we can scan to them.\\nHappy to discuss with her.\\ncdmfyiFYI.

Faced with\\ngovernment incompetence and corruption, people are rebelling.\\nBy Max Blumenthal\\nDec 4, 2002 I The body of another murdered woman was found late last month in the Mexican industrial hub of Ciudad\\nJuarez, dumped behind some shrubs in the squalor of the Anapra neighborhood, a ramshackle hodgepodge of corrugated\\ntin and cardboard shacks on the sludge-washed banks of the Rio Grande. Her hands had been tied, and the evidence\\nsuggested she had been raped. The body was so badly decomposed that investigators calculated that she\\'d been dead\\nfor seven months.\\nHowever horrific the details, they were numbing in their familiarity. The body of a woman who had died in similar\\ncircumstances was found in the same dusty lot a couple of months earlier. The bodies of eight women were found in a lot\\nnot far away a little more than a year ago. So many women have been murdered here in the past 10 years that there is no\\nreliable count. Most experts place it close to 325, an average of 32 a year, nearly three every month. At least 90 of the\\ndeaths are believed to be the work of one or more serial killers. Hundreds more women have simply vanished.\\nLike so many of the others, the woman whose body was found in late October had probably come to Juarez from the\\npoverty of southern Mexico to work for about $10 a day in one of the many foreign-owned assembly plants known as\\nmaquiladoras that sprouted up in Juarez after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994. And like\\nthem, too, her body was unclaimed in death and buried alone and anonymous.\\nSuch death has become a way of life here. So, too, with the fear and paranoia that rise in such a climate. Nobody knows\\nwho is doing the killings, and the mystery only seems to deepen. Arrests made by local authorities have produced\\nallegations of torture, witness tampering and frame-ups -- but no convictions. Most here believe that the killer or killers\\nmust have enormous clout. Perhaps, some say, the killers are narcotrafficantes disposing of witnesses. Perhaps they are\\nthe sons of the wealthy and powerful indulging in sick sex. Perhaps they are cultists whose members come from the\\nhighest levels of government and finance. The theories differ, but a common assumption is that arrests made thus far are\\nonly a smokescreen for an historically opaque and corrupt government that will protect its dark secrets at any cost.\\nOne thing seems clear: The murders arise from a social landscape that has been transformed by global economic forces.\\nWhere Ciudad Juarez was once a small, sleepy desert outpost just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the population\\nin the past decade has exploded to 1.2 million people, many of them drawn by the lure of the maquiladoras. The tides of\\npeople have overwhelmed the ability of the city to absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services and law\\nenforcement. Free-trade advocates once promised that NAFTA would transform Juarez into the City of the Future -- and\\nthey have been proven right in a way they never could have imagined. Today, Juarez still has the feel of the lawless Old\\nWest, but with a grim 21st century edge.\\nDespite promises of swift justice from Mexican President Vicente Fox and Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, they have\\nyet to take up offers of assistance from the FBI; bureau agents in Texas have suggested that official corruption is\\nhindering efforts to stop the murders. Chihuahua state investigators have seemingly adopted a \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell\" policy\\ntowards Juarez\\'s homicides, fostering an atmosphere of impunity and pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating in\\nJuarez that have employed many of the murdered women largely deny that such an atmosphere exists.\\nBut in this postmodern urban culture, where the very concept of community has broken down, many bereaved family\\nmembers and local activists have begun to take matters into their own hands, investigating the murders and speaking out\\neven if it means threats and other reprisals.\\nEvangeline Arce\\'s daughter, Silvia, a street vendor, disappeared on Nov. 3, 1998. Since that day, she said, the authorities\\nhave done little to investigate. \"Two days after my daughter disappeared, I went to the police and filed a report,\" the\\nmother says in Spanish, her face flaring with anger. \"They promised me prompt action but when I checked back a week\\nlater, the Missing persons report was never filed and the investigation had not even begun. When they finally got\\nwitnesses together, none of them would talk because they were too afraid.\"\\nEven as Mexico continues to make strides toward becoming an open and democratic society, the epidemic of rape and\\nmurder here has exposed the heavy residue of its corrupt and authoritarian political legacy as well as the contradictions of\\nits efforts at economic expansion.\\nTo understand the magnitude of the breakdown, think of the sniper rampage in the Washington area this fall that left 10\\npeople dead and three wounded. Imagine that Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held a press conference\\nand asked local citizens to catch the sniper themselves because local police were not up to the task and the federal\\ngovernment was not being helpful; imagine that the federal government charged that local officials in Montgomery County\\nwere complicit in the killings and impeding the investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. the number\\nof victims by 30, by 40, by 50, or more.\\nThat\\'s Juarez today.\\nThe jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core of this city has grown wildly in the wake of NAFTA, adding modern\\nshopping malls, condominiums and expansive boulevards. The population is growing at twice the rate of the national\\naverage; it is expected to nearly double by 2010, to 2 million people. Many of them directly or indirectly rely on the 300 or\\nso maquiladoras for their livelihoods.\\nTo accommodate the new army of workers, the city has given birth to entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez is a\\nluxurious conglomerate of gated communities, with a main gate that\\'s a life-size replica of Paris\\' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby,\\nmany of the maquiladoras are situated along the Avenida de la Industria. Though the assembly-line workers sometimes\\ncan be glimpsed behind a plate glass window in aqua-blue uniforms, there usually is little sign of any activity behind the\\nmaquiladoras\\' featureless walls.\\nMost of the new residents are poor, or on the brink of poverty, and they live in Anapra or another of the grim, violent\\ncolonias populares on the outskirts of town. In those colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water,\\nelectricity or paved roads.\\nAvenida Manuel Gomez Morin is the pothole-riddled six-lane avenue that ties these varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio\\nValle, a medium-sized strip mall, stands on a corner of the avenue at the gateway to the industrial sector. It is fronted by a\\nvast parking lot and inside are various clothing outlets and boutiques. By day, the lot bustles as customers scurry back\\nand forth, hauling their purchases to their cars -- a sight similar to any mall in the suburban United States. By night,\\nhowever, traffic tapers off, stores lock up and the mall\\'s lot becomes dark and desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle was where\\nmany of the slain and missing women were last seen.\\nIn the mall\\'s parking lot, Braulio Rosas, a 40-year-old security guard, leans against the door of a giant Nike outlet. Inside\\nthe store, under bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory and scramble to close up.\\n\"A lot of girls were picked up here,\" Roses says in a voice of calm resignation. \"But really, it\\'s the girls\\' fault. It\\'s because\\neven though they weren\\'t putas, [prostitutes] you know, they were more like fad/es [easy women]. They didn\\'t have to get\\ninto those cars if they didn\\'t want to.\"\\nRosas sounds cynical, but blaming the victims is by no means an aberration in Juarez. Similar notions have been offered\\nby officials like Suly Ponce, the former Chihuahua special prosecutor in charge of the murdered women\\'s cases.\\n\"Sometimes there are cases that a girl meets some person, he strikes up a relationship with her, they drink ... and it ends\\nviolently,\" she told the Washington Post in 2000, before she was promoted to a job in the governor\\'s office. \"It\\'s difficult to\\nknow.\"\\nA handful of the women found murdered since 1993 were indeed confirmed as prostitutes. But the truth is that a large\\nmajority of the missing or murdered women were hardworking, young, poor and for the most part socially conservative.\\nMost had migrated to Juarez from Mexico\\'s depressed south to work in the maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone and\\nwith little means of contacting their families back home.\\nThe maquiladoras, run by companies like Delphi and RCA Thomson, prefer to hire young women for assembly-line jobs.\\nAn entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, about $2 an hour. With experience, pay can rise to as much\\nas $2,50 an hour -- and compared to wages in Guerrero or Chiapas, that\\'s good money. But in Juarez, the women are\\ncaught in an economic trap: Since the cost of living here is only slighter lower than in El Paso, the wages that seem so\\nhigh to new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers can be hired and fired on the spot, with little\\npretext and no legal protection. And union activities are prohibited.\\nEven for those who accept the conditions, security is elusive. More often now, the global companies that own\\nmaquiladoras are closing up shop and transferring operations to China to take advantage of lower taxes, investment\\nsubsidies and outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced it was moving its P.C. monitor\\nmanufacturing operations, at a cost of 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers after shutting its plant\\ndown. According to the Nov. 5 New York Times, this trend has cost Juarez 287,000 jobs in the maquiladoras since their\\npeak in October 2000.\\nNot only does this slash and burn the economic base. There are brutal social reverberations, too. The city\\'s health\\nsystem, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, has reported 200,000 people falling from its list of insured after losing their\\ncompany policies, according to a July article in La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director of Juarez\\'s only battered-\\nwomen\\'s shelter, Casa Amiga, said in a speech this summer that domestic violence cases had risen by 50 percent in July\\nalone.\\nThe combination of poverty and a lack of social connections renders women on the assembly line powerless and virtually\\ninvisible. And that has made them easy prey. According to the El Paso Times, about a third of the approximately 325 slain\\nwomen were employed by maquiladoras at the time of their murder.\\nGiven that few of the maquiladoras provide shuttle service to and from the colonies, the female workers often are preyed\\nupon while walking through perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle in the darkness of the early morning. At such an hour,\\nthe only nearby activity is that of bars and nightclubs closing up as male patrons filter into the street after a long night of\\ndrinking.\\nBesides China\\'s attractive economic climate, an intangible cause of maquiladora flight is Juarez\\'s chronic violence. The\\neffect is difficult to measure. Two companies in the city\\'s industrial sector -- including TDK, the audio tape maker -- have\\nposted banners on their factories reading: \"STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Let\\'s Unite.\" But most foreign\\ncompanies are purely economic organisms governed entirely, it seems, by the dictates of efficiency. They have\\nmaintained a stunning silence even as their female workers are slaughtered.\\nConsider the case of 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body was found in November 2001 along with seven\\nothers in an overgrown cotton field on Avenida Technologico, just blocks from Sitio Colosio Valle mall and across the\\nstreet from the offices of the Association of Maquiladoras. She had worked on the assembly line for the Lear Corp., a\\nDetroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear has declined to publicly address Gonzalez\\'s murder.\\nGreg Bloom, editor of the Frontera Norte Sur -- an Internet news service that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border --\\nrecalled a conversation with Gonzalez\\'s mother, Josefina, in which she recounted her daughter\\'s last day. In the darkness\\nof the early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set out for her job at Lear. When she arrived at work a few minutes late\\nafter missing her bus, Claudia lvette was promptly sent away under a policy barring tardy assembly-line workers from their\\nshifts. A half-hour past when she usually would have returned home, her mother knew something was gravely wrong. Her\\nworst fear -- the same nagging fear shared by so many Juarez mothers -- would soon be realized.\\nAndrea Puchalsky, Lear\\'s director of communications, acknowledged that the company has not made any public\\nstatements regarding Gonzalez\\'s murder, nor has it enacted any proactive measures to protect employees from another\\nwave of violence. \"Adding security is not a question that relates to Lear,\" she said. \"[Gonzalez\\'s murder] did not happen\\non Lear property.\"\\nWhen questioned about the murder and Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned that a company memo was prepared for her\\nwith responses to possible questions. As to Lear\\'s worker-lockout policy, which apparently put Gonzalez in a precarious\\nsituation the day of her abduction, Puchalsky declined to comment on whether Gonzalez was locked out or sent home\\nfrom Lear\\'s plant on her last day.\\n\"We have a policy for tardiness and she was tardy many times,\" Puchalsky said. \"When she had arrived late to work her\\nshift, she was not there in time to work her shift.\"\\nWhen asked whether Lear\\'s offices in the U.S. have a similar policy in which late employees are barred from working their\\nshifts, Puchalsky reversed her earlier statement, vehemently denying that such a policy existed anywhere within Lear\\'s\\noperations. \"There is not a policy to send a worker home after X number of tardy arrivals,\" she said. \"Typically what we do\\nis if there is someone arriving late on kind of a warning system, there might be a notification that \\'the next time you arrive\\nlate, you have to take a day off ...\\' It\\'s not a policy, though. There is no written policy like that throughout Lear Corp.\"\\nThe body of 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia was found mutilated just 300 feet from her maquiladora in February 2001,\\nand since then her case has come to embody the incompetence and corruption of police and prosecutors from Ciudad\\nJuarez to the state capital in Chihuahua City and south all the way to Mexico City.\\nGarcia, the mother of a 5-month-old baby and a 2-year-old child, apparently was kidnapped just after she left work. She\\nwas held in captivity for a week, repeatedly beaten and raped, and then strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told the\\nJuarez newspaper El Diario that Garcia was the first woman of the year to be murdered and raped in this area of the city -\\n- even though two days before, the body of an unidentified woman was found naked just blocks away.\\nWhen an FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia\\'s killers to drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling\\nit erroneous. She instead blamed workers in a circus across the street from the strip mall where Garcia was last seen.\\nWhen circus managers claimed that Ponce offered them money to blame co-workers, she dropped the investigation.\\nAccording to a July article in the El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia\\nwas killed in a similar manner as three of the eight women found in the cotton field with Claudia \\'vette Gonzalez in\\nNovember 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved just as evasively in that investigation as in Garcia\\'s.\\nWhen Gonzalez and the seven other women\\'s bodies were found in November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General\\nArturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers as the culprits. Yet doubts about their guilt arose,\\nespecially after Grijalva -- who was Rascon\\'s evidence expert at the time -- resigned from his post, citing pressure to\\nfabricate evidence against them. And the head of a local prison was forced from office when he documented signs of\\ntorture on the accused men after they had returned from Rascon\\'s office.\\nFour months later, in February 2002, a search-and-rescue team combing the cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez\\'s\\noveralls in a plastic bag, along with strands of hair and other crucial pieces of evidence that Rascon\\'s investigators had\\nfailed to discover. In response, Rascon offered his opinion to the El Paso Times: \"The state police have done a thoroughly\\nprofessional job. I have no doubt about that.\" But on Oct. 28, DNA results revealed that Rascon\\'s investigators had\\nproperly identified only one of the eight dead women -- Gonzalez.\\nStuck with a far more dubious task than catching one madman or replacing one feeble leader, Juarez\\'s fractured civil\\nsociety has been paralyzed. A cynical mood is palpable just by speaking to citizens on the street, who unanimously\\nexpress fear and distrust of law-enforcement and government officials. Some local cops are just as cynical.\\n\"We can\\'t just sit around in deserted places waiting for someone to drive up and dump bodies off,\" said one municipal\\npolice officer seated in an idling paddy wagon who refused to give his name for security reasons. \"There are too few of us\\nand the city\\'s too big ... We don\\'t get much support from the federal government. Judicially, we are not protected like cops\\nin the U.S. Plus, the arms they give us are weak and the bulletproof vests don\\'t really stop bullets. It\\'s not just that,\\nthough. I have a young woman in my home so I can put myself in the place of the parents who have lost their daughters.\\nBut it\\'s a question of society. We need their support and they need them to be more conscious if it is going to get any\\nbetter here.\"\\nThe scope of the crime is so enormous, and there has been so little success in stopping it, that suspicion breeds on itself.\\nThe litany of theories as to who the killers are and what their motive might be suggests that Juarez has become a\\nbreeding ground for every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing is certain. And that feeds the climate of\\nparanoia.\\nGarcia and Gonzalez\\'s murders are rumored to be the work of a serial killer with possible ties to drug dealers. Yet Garcia\\nwas found with marks on her wrists that, according to local forensics experts, were identical to those made by police\\nhandcuffs. And upon the discovery of her daughter\\'s overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told the El Paso Times that someone\\npowerful was undoubtedly responsible for the murder.\\nMany in Mexico\\'s law enforcement community agree that a ring of rich men are behind some of the killings, but they have\\nno evidence to support the theory. Some suggest that some young men from the local aristocracy are responsible, but are\\nbeing protected by their parents. A persistent theory holds that the murders -- or a significant subset of them -- are linked\\nto powerful narcotraficantes who have co-opted segments of the local ruling class.\\nAnd the cynicism has been exacerbated by the fact that of the 17 men and one woman accused as serial killer\\nmasterminds of the murders, only one has been convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist and resident of\\nTexas at the time of his extradition to Mexico in 1995. Currently, Sharif is awaiting sentencing for allegedly paying a drug\\ntrafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno to carry out about a dozen murders. However, evidence against Sharif is\\nsuspect and charges against him have been changed repeatedly. Once he was even charged with killing a woman,\\nElizabeth Ontiveros, who showed up later at police offices to prove she was alive.\\nIn 1996, Sharif was accused of paying the gang Los Rebeldes to kill 17 women. Then, in 1999, he was charged with hiring\\nfive bus drivers and an El Paso man from his jail cell to kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired the killers to\\ndeflect blame from himself. By 1999, judges had cleared him of all charges, citing an absence of concrete evidence and\\nthe possibility of witness intimidation by prosecutors.\\nSuly Ponce, who supervised the case, has yet to make a compelling case against him. In a 1999 radio interview, rather\\nthan presenting hard evidence, she claimed Sharif was aggressively hostile toward women because of his Egyptian\\nbackground. Now she says that the case against Sharif hinges on Moreno\\'s declaration that Sharif paid him to carry out\\nthe killings with money he earned from 13 patents he developed for Benchmark Research and Technology. But according\\nto an article in the El Paso Times, Benchmark has never paid employees for patent development. In a telephone interview\\nlast week with Salon, Ponce said she hadn\\'t known this. Angela Paiaveras, the current special prosecutor, declined to\\ndiscuss Sharif\\'s case or any aspect of the investigations.\\nMany local residents scoff at the notion that the killers have been caught. \"We don\\'t believe that the guys they have\\narrested are the killers,\" says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, a mid-level manager for the Lear Corp. \"It\\'s obvious that they\\'re just\\nscapegoats.\"\\nYet Ponce remains ardent in her belief that Sharif is at the center of the murders. \"Today the killings continue because\\nthere are many imitators,\" she told Salon last week. \"But after Sharif was caught, there were almost no homicides for a\\nyear.\" But according to the Juarez daily El Diario, the year immediately after Sharif was jailed -- a period spanning from\\nOctober 1995 to October 1996 -- 28 young women were found murdered.\\nMeanwhile, the theories flourish and become more and more paranoid, reflecting a breakdown in public trust. By one\\npopular theory, the women are being murdered at blood rituals for a cabal of wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits\\na financial motive for murder. \"We\\'re finding a lot of girls that are mutilated in the same way,\" says a young municipal\\npolice officer who declined to give his name. \"Someone\\'s probably killing them to take their organs to sell them for a lot of\\nmoney in the U.S.\" When asked if there was any evidence to support the theory, the officer replied that it was only a\\nhunch.\\nSuch a climate sends a message to the killers every day: You can get away with anything, even a crime on this scale. But\\nwhere such a climate breeds cynicism and hopelessness among people who live and work here, it has also provoked an\\nincipient revolt.\\nOn her radio show \"Grueso Calibre\" (\"Large Caliber\"), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired the views of guests\\nwho were critical of how authorities handled the murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused the two bus drivers of\\nthe cotton field murders in November 2001, lzaguirre hosted the drivers\\' wives on her show. After that interview,\\nadvertisements began appearing in local newspapers smearing lzaguirre with claims that she frequented strip clubs and\\nwas romantically involved with one of the bus drivers. News media on both sides of the border have reported that the\\nreceipt for the ad was signed by government officials who paid for it.\\nThen, in February, when lzaguirre started organizing a vigil and announced a hunger strike on her show on Radio Canon,\\nshe was fired. Fearing for her safety, she moved across the border to El Paso.\\nOthers, too, have discovered that pressing the complaint too forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director of\\nNuestras Hijas Regreso a Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), a legal support group for victims\\' parents, was a frequent\\nguest on \"Grueso Calibre.\" Like Izaguirre, Ortiz has focused her resources on drawing attention to government and police\\nincompetence in the slain women\\'s cases. And she says that, like lzaguirre, she has faced ever-increasing danger.\\nIn Nuestras Hijas\\' office in central Juarez, located inside a small one-story row house with a \"For Rent\" sign out front,\\nOrtiz described the shadow of terror that has stalked her since she began pressuring the authorities.\\nShe claims she was threatened by ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. \"Rascon came all the way to\\nJuarez [from Chihuahua City] to tell me not to involve myself in all the cases,\" she tells Salon. \"Then I got a message on\\nmy phone saying: \\'You have daughters that are alive. Take care of them.\" Rascon, in an earlier story by the Associated\\nPress, denied the allegation.\\nLast May, Ortiz says, she was pursued by men in a black pickup truck who tried to kidnap her. She believes the attempt\\nwas orchestrated by Rascon\\'s office since it occurred only a day before she had planned to travel to El Paso for a meeting\\nwith the FBI and Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, who is calling for a bi-national investigation into the\\nmurders.\\nVictims\\' parents who came to Nuestras Hijas for help in finding their missing daughters also say they have been\\nthreatened. Mario Lee Lopez and his wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost their daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She was kidnapped\\nin 1995 along with their granddaughter, who was two months old. By now their granddaughter would be 7, and Lopez and\\nAguilar\\'s own investigation has led them to believe that she is alive and living in the custody of a well-connected local\\nfamily.\\nTo an outsider it is a desperate story, all but impossible to prove. Lopez accuses Ponce of coordinating the coverup of the\\nkidnappings and murder: again, Ponce denies the charge. And she was adamant that government officials have harassed\\nno one. \"I didn\\'t have any knowledge of threats against anybody,\" she said. \"On the contrary, we support the families and\\nthey are encouraged to be intimately involved in the investigations.\"\\nLopez recalls an incident in which he had gone to Juarez\\'s judicial building to press his granddaughter\\'s case and did not\\nexactly find the kind of support Ponce mentioned. While leaving the court, Lopez says, he was confronted by a high-\\nranking minister who warned that if he didn\\'t drop the investigation, he would be tortured with electric shock devices.\\n\"But it\\'s too late to stop now,\" Lopez adds with a wistful smile.\\nDespite the campaign against lzaguirre, or perhaps because of it, the vigil took place as scheduled in March. It was an\\nunprecedented show of solidarity, with thousands of people gathered in the cotton field where Gonzalez and the seven\\nothers were found in an irrigation ditch. There are still tatters of yellow police tape there, and candleholders left from the\\nvigil are strewn over the site. Eight red crosses mark the spot where the bodies were found.\\nHowever, city officials have no plans to memorialize the site as Juarez\\'s residents have. In fact, according to a Sept. 4\\narticle in El Diario, the site is now being used as a dumping ground for Juarez\\'s Department of Parks and Gardens.\\nNear downtown Juarez there is a monument to Abraham Lincoln, honoring him for \"establishing North American\\nindustries, today the most important in the world.\" Not far away is a simple gallery where the Collective Antigone [Antigone\\nCollective], a group of local artists, has organized a series of public performances, installations and conferences focused\\non Juarez\\'s crisis of violence.\\nEach week, the artists gather to collaborate and discuss strategy. At a table with 12 other artists and writers, in an\\nexpansive room filled with cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, a 51-year-old writer, describes the Collective\\'s\\ngoals and the problems confronting the group. \"Our government is authoritarian, and authoritarian governments are\\nprincipally concerned with the manipulation of life,\" he says. \"The victims\\' families feel manipulated by the authorities\\'\\ninsensitivity and this has manifested a greater and greater cynicism here that\\'s really dangerous. The struggle, then, is for\\nreparation and simply regaining our daily lives.\"\\nOrtega says he was moved to action by Samira Izaguirre\\'s candlelight vigil in March. He describes the building of an\\nimpromptu church in front of the Association of Maquiladoras office as an effort to \"communicate through a different\\nlanguage, one that\\'s symbolic.\" This decision, he says, helped lead to the formation of the Collective.\\nThe rallying cry for Collectiva Antigona, as evidenced by the name, has been Sophocles Greek tragedy, \"Antigone,\"\\nwhich tells the tale of a girl\\'s persecution at the hands of a cruel dictator for burying her brother. The Collectiva has\\norganized readings of the play around the state of Chihuahua and plans a public performance in the future.\\nThe Collectiva also has begun to establish a visual presence around central Juarez, most noticeably by painting a wall\\nspanning an entire block with poetry written by participants in a recent writer\\'s conference on violence against women. On\\nNov. 1 and 2, the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, the collective filled a room with traditional altars honoring the\\nvictims along with a giant cross in the center of the room covered with masks, intended to symbolize the anonymity of the\\nvictims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed the exhibit. A week later, working with Nuestras Hijas, the collective placed a\\ncoffin and flowers and had a bonfire in the cotton field ditch where Claudia Ivette Gonzalez and seven others were found.\\n\"It is absolutely necessary to affect civil society with the intention of shaking the indolence and to provoke some sort of\\nreaction from the people,\" says Mariela Paniagua, a 41-year-old painter. \"People are no longer affected by what is\\nhappening in this city. They have lost the capacity for outrage in the face of these acts.\"\\nWhile Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers a few miles away to combat Juarez\\'s violence by drastically\\ndifferent means. Past the seemingly endless rows of cardboard hovels in the desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond\\nthe municipal dump, on a rocky desert mesa in the shadow of Mount Indio, members of a search-and-rescue group called\\nBanda Civil spread out through the hills to search for more murder victims.\\nLuz Elena Guerrero Guerra, a strong-looking woman in her late 50s with an intense gaze, serves as president of one of\\nBanda Civil\\'s six divisions. Guerra tells of how it began as a search-and-rescue group in 1985 to assist during a massive\\nearthquake in Mexico City and evolved to respond to Juarez\\'s crisis. She herself found the first slain women\\'s bodies in\\n1989, before investigators had even identified the deadly trend. Today, Banda Civil\\'s members still lend their help during\\nnatural disasters but the bulk of their work comes in the search for bodies, monitoring of schools and a citywide crime-\\nawareness campaign.\\nEver-present terror, coupled with the impotence of Juarez\\'s authorities, forced Banda Civil\\'s transformation, Guerra says.\\n\"I\\'ve narrowly escaped violence many times,\" she explains. \"Sometimes it is just pure luck that a bus or a taxi happens to\\ncome by in time when someone is chasing me ... All of us, we\\'re uncertain of what the authorities are telling us. That\\'s our\\nindignation. If they [the authorities] aren\\'t interested in helping, we\\'ll pressure them.\"\\nBecause the group is required by law to cooperate with police, some view it with suspicion. Yet they have had success\\nwhere most other activist groups have failed. It was Banda Civil members who made the crucial discovery of Claudia\\nlvette Gonzalez\\'s overalls in February, humiliating Attorney General Rascon and breathing new life into the investigation.\\nAnd Banda Civil has continued to find more evidence during their weekly searches of Juarez\\'s human dumping grounds.\\nBesides its role as a search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil has the feel of a support group, providing\\nmembers with an outlet from the daily fear that comes with life in Juarez. According to Guerra, over 300 people have\\naccompanied the group on searches and many of them are family members of missing women. And indeed, the searches\\nare a family activity.\\nOn one recent Saturday, the search was joined by about 60 participants of all ages and from all sectors of Juarez society,\\nincluding a middle manager from the Lear Corp. There were no terrible discoveries that day, and yet afterward, as people\\nstood around talked and listened to norteno music blaring from a car stereo, it was evident just how deeply the murders\\nare ingrained into life here -- and how some people are fighting back with whatever tools they have at hand. Perhaps the\\nquiet optimism is derived from the age-old Mexican axiom that death brings about rebirth.\\n\"Instead of spending our time criticizing the authorities, we\\'re trying to find some solutions,\" says Santos. \"We all have\\nsisters and daughters here and we all feel the same. My daughter is in danger. I can\\'t let her live like this.\"\\n-- By Max Blumenthal\\n[3(\\nCopyright © 2010 Salon Media Group, Inc.

My response is always the same:\\nGermany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.\\nGermany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German\\nsociety. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and\\npeace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.\\nFrom the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany\\'s leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely\\nwithin a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not\\nremove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.\\nMany important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of\\nothers — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushed\\nthem with determination.\\nHelmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a common\\ncurrency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard. The euro\\nstability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.\\'s eastward\\nexpansion was Germany\\'s way of firming up its Eastern flank.\\nSlowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,\\nGermany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today\\'s misunderstanding is caused by\\nGermany\\'s success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in\\npursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.\\nA new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. \"Europe\" in the institutional sense has become\\nincreasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the German\\nConstitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel\\'s refusal to allow immediate assistance to\\nGreece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German Tea\\nParty?\\nHere we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany\\'s role as the \"motor of Europe.\" Ms. Merkel\\'s\\nunwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German\\nwillingness to \"salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,\" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.\\nGermans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who\\ncan do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-\\ndenial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that\\ncharacterizes many E.U. programs.\\nMost maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is\\nwhether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so sure\\nthat its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a\\nglobalized world.\\nAnd so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don\\'t want to hear. Not that\\nGermany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others\\nwhen it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.\\nThe growing gap between Germany\\'s aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to\\nburden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense of\\ncommon purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselves\\noften tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.\\nYounger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when they\\nrallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to \"Dare to Hope,\" which is the\\ncharacteristically timid German translation of the title of the president\\'s best seller. And they are still waiting. America\\nseems busy elsewhere.\\nThe main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a\\ndemocratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to\\nhaggle over the design. Weaving today\\'s 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for\\nGermany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.\\nUniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be\\njoined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness\\nmore energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy\\'s future as the operating system for a globalized world will be\\nassured.\\nEuropean fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and\\nthe United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its\\nside of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.\\nJohn Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador to\\nGermany from 1997 to 2001.Arabs gave green light.

Will prepare a call sheet for you.Below is the article I mentioned:\\nU.S. Revises Tack on Mideast Arms\\nWashington, Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons, in Effort to Steal Iran\\'s Thunder at U.N. Conference\\nBy JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA\\nThe U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks\\nto prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.\\nU.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by some\\nfor its silence about Israel\\'s undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as\\nIran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.\\nWashington also reassured Israel it won\\'t foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant\\nprogress has been made on Mideast peace.\\nThe U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a\\nbang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal\\nto disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel\\'s nuclear capability.\\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.\\nThe U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have\\nbeen pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran\\'s program.\\n\"The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party,\" said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The\\nofficial highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.\\nThe designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged\\nfrom a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995\\nagreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken\\nsince.\\nSenior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear\\nweapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt\\nwould resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and\\nTurkey.\\n\"We\\'ve made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before,\" said the senior\\nU.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.\\nU.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn\\'t believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in\\nArab-Israeli peace talks.\\n\"We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely\\nunless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted,\" said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms\\ncontrol and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members\\nof the Nonaligned Movement.\\nThe diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\\nNetanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.\\nconference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-security\\nconference in Washington in March due to such concerns.\\nAn Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that\\n\"it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the\\ncountries in the region.\"\\nThe U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama\\'s calls for a complete freeze in building new\\nJewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that\\nties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on track\\nnext week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration\\nwants to see.\\nEgypt\\'s latest proposal calls for Israel\\'s disarmament \"as soon as possible.\" It also called for Israel\\'s nuclear program to be\\nplaced under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.\\'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won\\'t\\nbe accepted, U.S. officials said.\\nThe Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release \"all information available to them on the nature and\\nscope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel.\"\\nU.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.\\nArms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task of\\ncalling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone.\\n\"They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections,\" said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation\\nEducation Center and a critic of the Obama administration\\'s arms-control approach.\\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. acceptance of a\\nspecial envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal, first floated by Russia, was\\npart of the U.S. offer.\\nThe last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for this\\nconference for nearly a year.\\nThe White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn\\'t escape inspections and\\nsanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could help\\nnations develop peaceful nuclear power.\\nWrite to Jonathan Weisman at jonathan.weisman@wsj.com, Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Joe Lauria at\\nnewseditor@wsj.comThis call will be after indonesia.

Richard Lugar, R-IN, \"The crisis should not be used as an excuse to win\\nincreases that could not otherwise be justified. As the requests for capital are negotiated with the international donor\\ncommunity, there is a window of opportunity for significant reform.\"\\nThe report, which is the culmination of six years of research, including half a dozen hearings when Lugar was committee\\nchairman, outlines several dozen recommendations for what the Obama administration, Congress, and the banks can do\\nto update their relevance.\\n\"Does the world really need the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank\\nfor Reconstruction and Development, and Inter-American Development Bank today? Can they be changed to better\\naddress our needs? How should we re-design them?\" the report asks.\\n\"Such questions are particularly timely because nearly all the IFIs have sought, or will soon seek, major new infusions of\\nmoney from their donors, including the taxpayers of the United States.\"\\nThe Asian Development Bank has already asked the Obama administration for new funds, and the administration has\\nrequested in its new budget $533 million in direct money and $12.8 billion in borrowing authority for the ADB.\\nA committee staffer told The Cable that Lugar wants to see progress on reform before he would support authorizing the\\nmoney.\\n\"We want to make sure that before the American taxpayer puts more money in there that things are fixed,\" the staffer\\nsaid. \"It\\'s not possible for them to do everything, but they could certainly make progress.\"\\nThe reforms the administration could press for in the short term include pressing the banks to focus more on\\ndevelopment goals rather than the structure and size of loans and \"work with the other donor countries to step back\\nand slow down the process,\" the staffer said.\\nCongress is also concerned that the Obama administration might not be interested in pressing for these reforms,\\nconsidering that Obama issued a signing statement in June indicating he did not feel bound to follow congressional\\ndirection on such international negotiations.\\nNegotiations between several banks and the Treasury Department are ongoing. The U.S. side is led by Scott Morris,\\ndeputy assistant secretary of the Treasury\\'s Office of International Development Finance and Debt.\\nThe issue will next surface at the end of March when the Inter-American Development Bank convenes its annual\\nmeeting in Cancun.\\nMichael H.

USA Pavilion Commissioner General Jose Villarreal and Consul General Beatrice\\nCamp greeted President Hu, who was accompanied by Vice Premier Wang Qishan, Shanghai Expo Bureau officials, and a\\nlarge contingent of Chinese media. Hu then walked through the pavilion\\'s initial section (the \"Overture\") where Vice\\nPremier Wang Qishan called attention to all the logos of the pavilion\\'s sponsors. The Chinese president also viewed a\\nfilm clip of President Obama welcoming visitors to the pavilion and shook hands with about 10 of the nearly 80 U.S.\\n\"student ambassadors\" staffing the pavilion. Before departing, President Hu thanked Commissioner General Villarreal\\nand wished the USA Pavilion great success.BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a\\nkindergarten in eastern China, state media reported on Thursday, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks. Xu\\nYuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday\\nmorning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were\\nall about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added. Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local\\ninsurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth\\nreported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures\\nto protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a\\nprimary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death\\neight school children last month. \"More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place,\" a\\ncommentary in today\\'s Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers.

Sid\\nFrom Gary Sick\\nMojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of\\nKings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime\\nand an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his\\nwords are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership.\\nToday he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the\\nstatement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have\\nadded my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say.\\n\"Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the\\nworld ever more energetically...\"\\n[real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and\\nAmerica\\'s credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.]\\n\"The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally\\ntowards the United States...\"\\n[Why can\\'t Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn\\'t have to keep answering questions about why we\\nwould not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.]\\n\"Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their\\nnumber which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said\\nthat he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did\\nthis happen? Of course not...\"\\n[The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our\\nfavorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi\\'i\\nreligious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead\\nof following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal,\\nand they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a\\nstraight face when they behave this way!]\\n\"There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran\\'s nuclear program or [the United State\\'s]\\nopposition towards the Iranian nation...\"\\n[Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time\\nwe sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the\\nuranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can\\'t trust anyone these days!]\\n\"We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and\\nrespected...\"\\n[All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if\\nSarah Palin has any chance? We\\'ll keep our fingers crossed.]\\n\"The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new\\nfriends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them...\"\\n[We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately\\nexpressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the\\nworld.

The first order of business,\\nhowever, is to try to get this spill under control, which has been, as you know, very difficult, and to prevent further\\ndamage to the coastline along Louisiana to the fishing waters, to the wildlife. I think it does raise questions which the\\nPresident has said have to be answered. He put forth a very comprehensive approach that included the potential of\\ndrilling off of our own shores. That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our\\ndependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can\\'t be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars\\ncleaning up these spills.

Sid\\nhtto://www. haaretz.com/hasers/spagesil 158992. html\\nAluf Benn / Netanyahu leaves U.S. disgraced, isolated and weaker\\nBy Ake Berm\\nDetails emerging from Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s visit to Washington remain incomplete, but the conclusion may nonetheless\\nbe drawn that the prime minister erred in choosing to fly to the United States this week. The visit - touted as a fence-\\nmending effort, a bid to strengthen the tenuous ties between Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama - only\\nhighlighted the deep rift between the American and Israeli administrations.\\nThe prime minister leaves America disgraced, isolated, and altogether weaker than when he came.\\nInstead of setting the diplomatic agenda, Netanyahu surrendered control over it. Instead of leaving the Palestinian issue\\naside and focusing on Iran, as he would like, Netanyahu now finds himself fighting for the legitimacy of Israeli control over\\nEast Jerusalem.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe most sensitive and insoluble core issues - those which when raised a decade ago led to the dissolution of\\nthe peace process and explosion of the second intifada - are now being served as a mere appetizer.\\nAt the start of his visit, Netanyahu was tempted to bask in the warm welcome he received at the AIPAC conference, at\\nwhich he gave his emotional address on Jerusalem.\\nTaking a page from Menachem Begin, he spoke not on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the Jewish people\\nitself and its millennia of history.\\nHis speech was not radical rightist rhetoric. Reading between the lines, one could spot a certain willingness to relinquish\\nWest Bank settlements as long as Israel maintains a security buffer in the Jordan Valley.\\nBut at the White House, the prime minister\\'s speech to thousands of pro-Israel activists and hundreds of cheering\\ncongressmen looked like an obvious attempt to raise political capital against the American president.\\nKnowing Netanyahu would be reenergized by his speech at the lobby, Obama and his staff set him a honey trap. Over the\\nweekend they sought to quell the row that flared up during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden\\'s trip here two weeks ago, and\\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Netanyahu\\'s response to the ultimatums Washington presented to him\\nas \"useful.\"\\nSpecial envoy George Mitchell made a televised visit to the prime minister\\'s bureau Sunday to invite Netanyahu to the\\nWhite House. Washington, it seemed, was trying to make nice.\\nFar from it. Just when Netanyahu thought he had resolved the crisis by apologizing to Biden, Clinton called him up for a\\ndressing down.\\nThis time as well, Netanyahu almost believed the crisis had passed, that he had survived by offering partial. noncommittal\\nanswers to the Americans\\' questions. Shortly before meeting with Obama, Netanyahu even warned the Palestinians that\\nshould they continue to demand a freeze on construction, he would postpone peace talks by a year.\\nHis arrogant tone underscored the fact that Netanyahu believed that on the strength of his AIPAC speech, he could call\\nthe next few steps of the diplomatic dance.\\nBut then calamity struck. At their White House meeting, Obama made clear to his guest that the letter Netanyahu had\\nsent was insufficient and returned it for further corrections. Instead of a reception as a guest of honor, Netanyahu was\\ntreated as a problem child, an army private ordered to do laps around the base for slipping up at roll call.\\nThe revolution in the Americans\\' behavior is clear to all. On Sunday morning Obama was still anxiously looking ahead to\\nthe House of Representatives vote on health care - the last thing he wanted was a last-minute disagreement with\\ncongressmen over ties with Israel.\\nThe moment the bill was passed, however, a victorious Obama was free to deal with his unruly guest.\\nThe Americans made every effort to downplay the visit. As during his last visit in November, Netanyahu was invited to the\\nWhite House at a late hour, without media coverage or a press conference. If that were not enough, the White House\\nspokesman challenged Netanyahu\\'s observation at AIPAC that \"Jerusalem is not a settlement.\"\\nThe Americans didn\\'t even wait for him to leave Washington to make their disagreement known. It was not the behavior\\nWashington shows an ally, but the kind it shows an annoyance.\\nThe approval of construction at the Shepherd Hotel in Sheikh Jarrah, announced before his meeting with Obama, again\\ncaught Netanyahu unawares. Apparently the special panel appointed after the Ramat Shlomo debacle to prevent such\\nsurprises failed its first test.\\nNetanyahu is having his most difficult week since returning to office, beginning with the unfortunate decision to relocate\\nthe planned emergency room at Ashkelon\\'s Barzilai Medical Center and lasting through his humiliating jaunt through\\nWashington.\\nReturning to Israel today, Netanyahu will need to work hard to rehabilitate his image, knowing full well that Obama will not\\nrelent, but instead demand that he stop zigzagging and decide, once and for all, whether he stands with America or with\\nthe settlers.Of course.\\nLona Valmoro\\nS ecial Assistant to the Secretary of State\\n(direct) B6Well most of the weekend planes are the little planes.

He also worked for Clinton Admn and helped with disaster relief (including earthquakes)\\naround the world. He called me today with some suggestions (some of which may be moot), so I asked him to put them\\ninto a memo. Here it is, for what it\\'s worth:\\nI think the fundamental issue is that no one seems to be in charge and no\\none person has been tasked with trying to pull all of the pieces together\\ninto a short term and long term plan. Obviously in the short term, search\\nand rescue and food and water are the main priorities. There seems to be\\nlittle communication between the various areas where people have congregated\\nand a central command post where agencies can call or radio for additional\\nsupplies including food, water and medical.\\nI don\\'t recommend DoD be put in charge of this. They rarely have the kind of\\ntouch that brings together all the necessary agencies under one roof. I\\nwould set up a central command that has representatives from all federal\\nagencies in one place. There is no reason things should be this\\ndisorganized. I would break the island into grids and assign one person to\\nbe the coordinator for each of the grids. That person will be responsible\\nfor all activities within their grid and will report activities to the\\nisland on-scene coordinator. We should get a radio company like Motorola to\\nset up temporary towers and give the State Department several hundred radios\\nso everyone involved in the response is able to communicate with the command\\npost and with each other.\\nI think one of the most important roles for DoD is to provide security for\\nthe rescue teams and medical teams. They also should be responsible for the\\noperation of the airport, for off loading planes and for scheduling all\\nincoming flights so there is no lost time waiting for planes to land. I also\\nthink DoD should be responsible for airlifting supplies that are requested\\nby each one of the grid coordinators. Additionally, the helicopters should\\nbe used to move critical patients to the hospital ship on the way and to the\\naircraft carrier currently on station. At least once a day, the coordinator\\nassigned by the President and the Secretary of State should be responsible\\nfor getting situation reports from all agencies on site, particularly\\nregarding food and water, security, medical and search and rescue.\\nThe lack of command and control is allowing the situation to become more\\nchaotic rather than more coordinated. I believe that if the Secretary were\\nto talk to the other nations involved through the UN, they would be\\nsupportive of better coordination.\\nBottom line is that there is no order to the operation and you need strong\\npeople in there who can speak on behalf of the President and the Secretary\\nand get things under control quickly.\\nI hope this is helpful. If you or the Secretary have any questions please\\nfeel free to call me on my cell We leave for Tokyo at 7:15 am\\ntomorrow and transfer to a United flight due back in DC at 2:30 pm tomorrow.\\nPlease give the Secretary my best regards. I hope to see you soon.\\nB6FYI below on French statement on Haiti and U.S. support:\\nParis, January 19, 2010\\nCOMMUNIQUE\\nDuring their telephone conversation last week, the President of the Republic and President Obama expressed the\\nresolute commitment of our two countries in Haiti, and decided to combine their efforts in order to deal with the urgent\\nhumanitarian situation and to respond, in the future, to the enormous reconstruction requirements.\\nThe French authorities have, since then, been entirely satisfied with the cooperation between our two countries and,\\nbeyond that, the continuous coordination between the Crises Centers of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs\\nand the U.S. Department of State.

Secretary of Defense\\nGates\\' meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, and his comments that the \"U.S. wants to increase the military\\nfunding of Pakistan\" received coverage. Pak Army Chief General Kayani\\'s remarks that the \"military is willing\\nto forgo its requests for hardware to ensure that Pakistan\\'s energy and economic needs are met\" were also\\nreported. Reports that GOP and the opposition are not on same page regarding talks with the U.S. received\\nfront-page display. The civilian nuclear deal issue made news as \"The News,\" reported that the \"FO seeks to\\nhide unease over nuclear snub\" and \"The Nation,\" reported on front-page that \"U.S. affirms durable partnership\\nbut no civilian N-deal.\" However Foreign Office spokesman\\'s remarks, that the \"government is optimistic about\\na positive outcome\" was also reported.

Sid\\nhttp://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_sto\\nry\\nThe Petraeus briefing: Biden\\'s embarrassment\\nis not the whole story\\nPosted By Mark Perry 4Saturday, March 13, 2010 -\\nOn Jan. 16, two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti, a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command\\n(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of\\nStaff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM\\ncommander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-\\nslide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among\\nArab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOM\\'s mostly Arab constituency was losing\\nfaith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in\\nthe region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) \"too old, too slow ... and\\ntoo late.\"\\nThe January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on\\nwhat is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed\\nfrom a December 2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeus\\'s instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders.\\n\"Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling,\" a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. \"America\\nwas not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding.\" But Petraeus wasn\\'t finished: two days\\nafter the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which, with\\nIsrael, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus\\'s reason\\nwas straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arab\\nleaders as engaged in the region\\'s most troublesome conflict.\\n[UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House.\\n\"CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue, and CENTCOM did\\npropose a UCP change, but to CJCS, not to the WH,\" the officer said via email. \"GEN Petraeus was not certain what\\nmight have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS.\"\\n(UCP means \"unified combatant command,\" like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)]\\nThe Mullen briefing and Petraeus\\'s request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeus\\'s request that\\nCENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied (\"it was dead on arrival,\" a Pentagon officer confirms),\\nthe Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue,\\nsending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the\\nchief of the Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen\\'s trip\\nfocused on Iran, the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough, message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: that\\nIsrael had to see its conflict with the Palestinians \"in a larger, regional, context\" -- as having a direct impact on America\\'s\\nstatus in the region. Certainly, it was thought, Israel would get the message.\\nIsrael didn\\'t. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu\\ngovernment was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the administration reacted. But no one was more outraged\\nthan Biden who, according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange with the\\nIsraeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to\\nPetraeus\\'s Mullen briefing: \"This is starting to get dangerous for us,\" Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. \"What you\\'re doing\\nhere undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and it\\nendangers regional peace.\" Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: \"The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since many\\npeople in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel\\'s actions and US policy, any decision about\\nconstruction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of\\nAmerican troops fighting against Islamic terrorism.\" The message couldn\\'t be plainer: Israel\\'s intransigence could cost\\nAmerican lives.\\nThere are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA, the American Medical Association, the lawyers -- and the\\nIsraeli lobby. But no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits might\\nreflect that Joe Biden\\'s trip to Israel has forever shifted America\\'s relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the real\\nbreak came in January, when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America\\'s\\nrelationship with Israel is important, but not as important as the lives of America\\'s soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the message\\nnow.\\nMark Perry\\'s newest book is Talking To Terrorists\\nhttp://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/\\nMy piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment, as\\nwell as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Is\\nthere any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expand\\nCENTCOM — or even hostility towards Israel.\\nI won\\'t name my sources, even though it\\'s clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — who\\nthey are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in the\\nbriefing — the two briefers, Admiral Mullen, and Admiral Mullen\\'s primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinian\\nconflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for the\\nreader to determine. The account is not only accurate, it\\'s a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more to\\nit. The White House, State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account, and for good reason: it\\'s true.\\nIs there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing?\\nI have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Four Stars, is\\nthe authoritative account on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. I\\nhave never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that General\\nPetraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhance\\ntheir own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his country\\nand he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test of\\nGeneral Petraeus\\'s loyalty to Israel, but of his, and our, concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East.\\nIt is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of \"the Biden crisis\" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated into\\nwhether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel\\'s security. This isn\\'t about Israel\\'s security, it\\'s about\\nour security.\\nhttp://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and-\\nnetanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/\\nNetanyahu and Pastor Hagee\\'s Lovefest on Eve of Biden\\'s\\nArrival in Israel\\nOn 03.09.10, By Max\\n(Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.)\\nVice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved the\\nconstruction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Biden\\'s mission to\\nhelp jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset his\\nplans by Netanyahu\\'s appearance with John Hagee.\\nThe day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu, and a day\\nbefore Biden\\'s arrival, Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagee\\'s\\nNight To Honor Israel, an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry\\'s millions in donations to\\nIsraeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel\\'s perceived enemies.\\nAt the gathering, Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \"the Hitler of the Middle East\" and denounced\\nthe Goldstone Report as \"character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee.\"\\nNetanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem, a city he described as \"the undivided,\\neternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then, he told them, \"I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!\" He used the rest of\\nhis speech to call for \"tough, biting sanctions\" against Iran that \"bite deep into its energy sector.\"\\nHagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage:\\nr--\\nX\\nIn the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government, from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem Mayor\\nNir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegal\\nWest Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend, fugitive\\nbillionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressional\\ndelegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street.\\nPart One of Hagee\\'s speech:\\nX\\nPart Two.\\nX\\nPastor Hagee in Jerusalem 3/8/10 (Part II) from Max J Blumenthal on Vimeo.\\nHagee\\'s ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries that\\ntotaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion and\\nShomron, which was involved in promoting an \"Obama Hilltop project\" that promoted more settlement building and\\ncompared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated from\\nGush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel\\'s assault on Gaza in 2009, a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israel\\ngovernment to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region.\\nWho is Hagee funding in Israel?\\nX\\nWho Is Haoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo.\\nThe most notable of Hagee\\'s funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of this\\ngroup appeared in the film to thank Hagee for \"help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path, the path\\nof Zionism, the love of Israel, the path of solidarity.\" Another student called for \"the second revolution in Israel.\"\\nIn February, Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director Naomi\\nChazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New Israel\\nFund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report.\\nThe smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israeli\\nhuman rights groups. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy, a\\ncolumnist for Ha\\'aretz, called Im Tirtzu \"a McCarthyite movement\" for its attacks on Chazan.\\nAlthough CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu\\'s campaign, the organization\\'s appearance during CUFI\\'s\\nJerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future.\\nRepublican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign after\\nHagee\\'s statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has also said that\\nhe believed the anti-Christ was \"partially Jewish, as was Adolph Hitler.\" However, none of Hagee\\'s comments have\\ndeterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity.\\nDuring Hagee\\'s speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source of\\ndifficulties between the US and Israel. \"The settlements are not the problem,\" he boomed from the podium. \"The problem\\nis the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East.\"\\nHagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when he\\nproclaimed, \"World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do in\\nthe city of Jerusalem. They don\\'t have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and cannot\\nlive there.\"\\nThe following day, on March 9, Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials from\\nthe Palestinian Authority. He told reporters after touching down that he saw \"a moment of real opportunity.\"Outreach Center\\nFrom Al Quds should be the front piece of all our presentations IMadam Secretary, .\\nThanks so much for the experience of a life time.

The MPs conclude that British prime ministers have to\\nlearn to be less deferential to US presidents and be \"willing to say no\" to America.\\nThe report, entitled Global Security: UK-US Relations, says Britain\\'s relationship with America is \"extremely close and\\nvaluable\" in a number of areas, particularly intelligence co-operation. However, it adds that the use of the phrase special\\nrelationship, in its historical sense, \"is potentially misleading and we recommend that its use should be avoided\".\\nIt does not reflect the \"ever-evolving\" relationship between the two countries and raises unrealistic expectations, the MPs\\nsay.\\n\"Over the longer term, the UK is unlikely to be able to influence the US to the extent it has in the past,\" the committee\\nadds.\\nIn an apparent rebuke to Tony Blair and his relationship with President George W Bush, the report says there are \"many\\nlessons\" to be learnt from Britain\\'s political approach towards the US over Iraq.\\n\"The perception that the British government was a subservient poodle to the US administration is widespread both among\\nthe British public and overseas,\" the MPs say. \"This perception, whatever its relation to reality, is deeply damaging to the\\nreputation and interests of the UK.\"\\nWhile the relationship between the American president and the British prime minister was an important part of dealings\\nbetween the two countries, the cabinet and parliament also had a role to play. \"The UK needs to be less deferential and\\nmore willing to say no to the US on those issues where the two countries\\' interests and values diverge,\" the MPs say.\\nThey are also critical of the US use of extraordinary rendition and torture. The report calls for a comprehensive review of\\nthe use by the CIA of British bases, such as that on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, to carry out extraordinary\\nrendition.\\n\"The issues relating to rendition through Diego Garcia to which we have previously drawn attention raise disturbing\\nquestions about the uses to which US bases on British territory are put\", the MPs say.\\nThey express regret at \"considerable restraints\" on the ability of both the government and parliament to scrutinise US\\nactivities carried out on British territory.\\n\"We recommend that the government should establish a comprehensive review of the current arrangements governing\\nUS military use of facilities within the UK and in British overseas territories.\" The review should \"identify shortcomings in\\nthe current system of scrutiny and oversight ... and report to parliament on proposals to remedy these\".\\nThe report also demands a statement from the government on the implications of the Court of Appeal judgment regarding\\nthe alleged collusion of MI5 in the torture of Binyam Mohamed, a British resident.\\nLast month the court ordered the government to release evidence from American intelligence reports which showed that\\nMI5 was aware of the torture.\\nSenior US officials subsequently suggested that releasing such evidence might prevent the US from sharing some\\nintelligence with Britain.\\nContact our advertising team for advertising and sponsorship in Times Online, The Times and The Sunday Times, or\\nplace your advertisement.\\nTimes Online Services: Dating I Jobs I Property Search I Used Cars I Holidays I Births lvlarriages, Deaths I\\nSubscrlptions I E-paper\\nNews International associated websites: Milkround\\nCopyright 2010 Times Newspapers Ltd.\\nThis service is provided on Times Newspapers\\' standard Terms and Conditions.

Fourteen MPs\\nskipped the vote.\\nSame-sex couples will be able to marry starting June 27.\\nThe registered-partnership apparatus that gay couples used in the past will no longer be available.\\nThe national LGBT association, Samtokin 78, said Iceland had removed the last obstacle to equal rights for all.\\nIceland is the ninth nation where same-sex couples can marry nationwide and the 11th nation where same-sex\\nmarriage is possible.\\nIcelandic Prime Minister Johanna Siguroardottir is openly lesbian.\\nGay marriage also is legal in Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain,\\nSweden, Mexico City, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Washington, D.C.Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a\\ncall.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:\\nThe Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the\\ncivilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet\\nreiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel\\'s legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons\\nsmuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the\\nreunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of\\nhumanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council\\nresolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and\\ninternational donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of\\nthe Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.\\nConsistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as\\nconsulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in\\nGaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet\\nnotes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the\\neffectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards\\nmeeting the needs of Gaza\\'s population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and\\ninfrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work\\nwith Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as\\nquickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in\\nconsultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will\\nactively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and\\npromote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.\\nThe Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local\\nnon-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully\\nenable this work.\\nThe Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes\\nefforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The\\nQuartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and\\nammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their\\ncargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for\\nunnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.\\nThe Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his\\ncapture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas\\' international obligation to provide him access by the\\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.\\nThe Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct\\nbilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these\\nnegotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation\\nwhich began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the\\nWest Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.Article from cdmWe are characterizing it this way. Our only rep in the chair, a working-level officer, walked out with many other\\ncountries in solidarity over the first of a series of accusations in his speech. We are trying to keep our first response\\nlimited. Later we can add more specificity.\\nPJAs I mentioned last week, I was on a panel at the Brussels forum with Lady Ashton (who insisted everyone call her\\nCathy), Estonian president Toomas lives, and Senator Voinovich. Ashton and I essentially reinforced each other at every\\nturn and presented a very positive vision of US-EU partnership. She has scored some significant victories lately, most\\nnotably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk\\n(the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed,\\nAshton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers\\nmeet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and state-\\nbuilding budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the development\\ncommissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy and\\nthen presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants. We should be able to build on the\\nway the EU is organizing in pushing pushing our own integrated frame here.\\nI hope everything goes well on Ottawa and NY. Bob Hormats and I will send a note on other aspects of Brussels forum,\\nwhere US was well represented.

But WikiLeaks has\\npreviously posted government and corporate documents that were later verified.\\nThe report by a CIA expert on \"strategic communications\" and State Department analysts of public opinion\\nwarned that popular support for the war in Europe was weak and could easily collapse, citing the recent fall of\\nthe Dutch government over the issue.\\n\"The tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in French or German casualties or in Afghan civilian\\ncasualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate\\nwithdrawal,\" it said.\\nThe analysis, dated March 11, suggested public relations strategies to drum up support for the war in Germany\\nand France, which maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in Afghanistan.\\n\"Outreach initiatives that create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with French,\\nGerman, and other European women could help to overcome pervasive skepticism among women in Western\\nEurope toward the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) mission,\" it said.\\nPublic relations efforts could \"tap into acute French concern for civilians and refugees,\" the report said,\\nsuggesting highlighting polls that show most Afghans support the presence of coalition troops.\\nSuch an approach could stress the potential dangers facing Afghan civilians if NATO-led troops were defeated\\nand \"leverage French (and other European) guilt for abandoning them.\"\\n\"The prospect of the Taliban rolling back hard-won progress on girls I- education could provoke French\\nindignation, become a rallying point for France\\'s largely secular public, and give voters a reason to support a\\ngood and necessary cause despite casualties.\"\\nFor German audiences, marketing efforts should underline how Afghans are reportedly optimistic about the\\nNATO mission and how an international retreat would damage Germany\\'s interests.\\n\"For example, messages that illustrate how a defeat in Afghanistan could heighten Germany\\'s exposure to\\nterrorism, opium, and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics,\" it said.\\nThe report also suggested taking advantage of President Barack Obama\\'s popularity in France and Germany,\\narguing that appeals from the US president on the importance of the allied role in the war could have a positive\\neffect.\\nThe memorandum is titled: \"Afghanistan: Sustaining West European Support for the NATO-led Mission -- Why\\nCounting on Apathy Might Not Be Enough.\"\\nMedia Analysis and Watch Center\\nUSSTRATCOM Foreign Media Analysis Program\\nSOS International Ltd.\\nwww.sosiltd.comWill do. 111 talk to Ryabkov in the morning.

The speech suggested that US\\nnonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselves\\nand that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointed\\nattacks on the USG, from the USAF\\'s security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us\\n\"the most hated\" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have used\\nnuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 \"proposals\", most of which were previewed\\nin Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs, suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten with\\nnuclear weapons, disarming all US nuclear bases, support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC.\\nThe US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech.Jim concurs in the memo recommendations.okBombings in Moscow\\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this morning\\'s bombings in Moscow, their families, and all the people\\nof Russia.

We\\nare deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political\\nfreedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in\\nfurther dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation,\\nharassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge\\nthe parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri\\nparticipation.\\nIrrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA\\ndeadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will\\nsupervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan,\\nand to negotiate sustainable post-CPA arrangements in areas such as wealth-sharing, citizenship and assets, and\\nliabilities.\\nWe reiterate our commitment to ensure that the referenda must happen on schedule and that their outcomes need to\\nbe respected. It is time to redouble efforts to achieve these ends. We urge all parties in Sudan and all regional and\\ninternational partners to work together to achieve the peaceful future that the people of Sudan deserve.I did.

When Nixon\\nwanted foreign policy advice, everyone knew\\nwhere he got it from: Henry \\'Kissinger, variously\\nhis national security adviser and secretary of\\nstate.\\nIn contrast, Mr Obama has no big foreign policy\\nstrategist. Even insiders give different answers\\nwhen asked to whom he turns for advice on the\\nbig international questions. But almost all agree\\nwith the following observation. \"The truth is that\\nPresident Obama is his own Henry Kissinger —\\nno one else plays that role,\" says a senior official.\\n\"Every administration reflects the personality of\\nthe president. This president wants all the trains\\nBarack Obama at the Great Wall of China last year. Unlike his\\npredecessor Richard Nixon, who turned to Henry Kissinger for\\nadvice, the US president has no big foreign policy strategist\\nrouted through the Oval Office.\"\\nFifteen months after he took office, the character and structure of Mr Obama\\'s foreign policy machinery is still evolving.\\nBut from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders, including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised to\\nspeak, and three former national security advisers, it is clear the buck not only stops with, but often floats for quite a long\\ntime around, Mr Obama himself.\\nForeigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one — the passage\\nlast week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself,\\nhis centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential attention, say\\ncritics.\\n\"On the positive side, we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely,\" says the official. \"On the debit\\nside, for all the president\\'s intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn\\'t have\\nmuch depth on some issues.\\'\\nThe core of Mr Obama\\'s foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council, which advises\\nthe president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,\\nmilitary commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones, whom, to many\\npeople\\'s surprise, Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.\\nOnly briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows little\\ninterest in running the \"inter-agency\" process — a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels\\nfrequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National Security\\nCouncil, known as the \"principals meeting\", not Gen Jones.\\nRahm Emanuel, Mr Obama\\'s chief of staff, is also a key part of it. \"If you were to ask me who the real national security\\nadviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom Rehm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the least\\nimportant,\" says another official.\\nAnyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreign\\ngovernments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, he\\ndoes not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, Gen\\nJones provoked laughter when he said: \"I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually did\\nwhat you asked them to do. In my new role I\\'m finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation.\"\\nThe lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-\\nIsraeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed Geproe Mitphspil as his\\nenvoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arab\\nconfidence in the talks.\\nIn a heated ;34.16NA(dpyin the ,Clvg\\nli..0f7;ce. last May, in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama\\'s demand, the\\nonly officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the campaign.\\nGen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.\\n\"The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what the\\nnext step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said \\'No\\'?\" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration and\\nformer head of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Why wasn\\'t George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?\"\\nMr Obama\\'s character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by Tom Donilon, deputy\\nnational security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent \"deputies\\' meetings\", which\\ncan sometimes consume four to six hours a day.\\nDescribed by one insider as \"the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn\\'t widely known\", Mr Donilon,\\nwho was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama\\'s trains running on time. And there are\\na lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as \"clinically insane\" by a former\\nsenior diplomat under Bill Clinton.\\nBut as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. \"People\\nforget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush\\'s\\ntwo terms] in America\\'s power and reputation in our history,\" says a senior official. \"It took time to put in place a process\\nthat could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take.\"\\nAlso the organiser of Mr Obama\\'s 9.30arn national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed to\\nprevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model devised by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to George\\nBush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden\\'s team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of \"parallel\\nprocess\" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.\\n\"If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in iraq was taken, you cannot find it,\" says the\\nsenior official. \"By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions.\"\\nThe deputies\\' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Don;Ion and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,\\noften go on holiday together. Mr Donilon\\'s wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president\\'s wife. Mr\\nSteinberg\\'s wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John Holdren, Mr Obama\\'s chief scientific adviser.\\nAll those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the US\\nambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clinton\\nadministration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together: \"A lot of work gets done in that group,\" says\\nMs Flournoy. \"Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going.\"\\nThe refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama\\'s decision in December to\\nsend another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval\\nOffice meetings.\\nBut the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama\\'s time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.\\n\"Time is the most precious commodity a president has,\" says a former national security adviser. \"On average he is only\\ngoing to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent.\"\\nThe widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine room.\\nThose who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis\\nMcDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are\\nwidely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.\\nDescribed by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama\\'s \"Lord High Executioner\", Mr McDonough \"has appended himself to the Chicago\\ncrowd\", says another official. Mr McDonough\\'s widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama\\'s\\nforeign policy apparatus.\\nOnce an adviser to former Senate majority leader Tom Deschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama\\'s side\\nduring the campaign. Insiders describe him as the \"enforcer\" and as the keeper of \"message discipline\", a key element of\\nany campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.\\n\"McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they\\'re very close,\" says\\nan official. \"Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round.\"\\nIndeed, if Mr Obama\\'s highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough\\'s. \"Donilon has\\nbeen perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table,\" says David Rothkopf, a former\\nClinton official and scholar on the NSC. \"Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that\\nwas taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren\\'t invited.\"\\nMr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-level\\nmeetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade policy,\\nwhich continues to drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.\\nAnd it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama\\'s political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they are\\nabsent, such as on the president\\'s decision to begin the rog,,g: witsirawal from anistan. in July 2011 — a\\nrecommendation that came from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.\\nOn the plus side. Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus\\nside also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.\\nBush.\\n\"At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with a\\nreal lawyer\\'s clarity,\" says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton. \"When\\nthe president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment.\"\\nWhen Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.\\nSTATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS\\nAn \\'alliance of the unsackables\\' finds it can confront the inner circle\\nIf there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the\\nalliance between Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president\\'s secretaries of state and defence.\\nMrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama\\'s tenure, forging a strong working\\nrelationship with her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson\\ninternationally — if not at home, where Mr Obama\\'s inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.\\nMr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the\\ncredibility he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a\\nholdover from the Bush administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no\\ncoincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the only other unsackable cabinet member.\\nThe combination has made itself felt in some of the administration\\'s most significant debates, notably on\\nAfghanistan, where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.\\n\"Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted,\" says one official, who notes\\nthat while the traditional role of the NSC is to \"play referee\" between the state and defence departments,\\nit is as often nowadays a combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how\\nit worked when Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell held those positions.\\n\"We work together well,\" Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. \"I think it\\nstarts with, frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge that\\nthe secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy.\"\\nTheir outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on\\ndiplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran, both favour tough\\nsanctions; on Russia, both have sought to reassure Moscow\\'s neighbours even while improving relations\\nwith the Kremlin.\\nBut for all their workmanlike co-operation, there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the\\nObama inner circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant \"residue of friction\"\\nbetween Mr Obama\\'s and Mrs Clinton\\'s teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs\\nClinton\\'s chief of staff, has had several run-ins with others in the administration.\\nOne official describes Mrs Clinton as \"totally loyal\" to Mr Obama. He adds: \"She and the president are not\\nthe best of friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency — she was married to a\\npresident and she wanted to be one ... She still might be.\"\\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2010. Print a single copy of this article for personal use.

Holbrooke, the Obama administration\\'s special\\nrepresentative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the\\nuproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal\\'s career-ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.But privately, at least\\none senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal\\'s exit as an excuse for a housecleaning, according to\\nsenior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support,\\nthese people said.ln recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry\\nmight be replaced by Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership\\nwith General Petraeus during the successful Iraq troop increase. Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr.\\nCrocker\\'s prestigious new post at Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the\\nchallenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how\\nsoldiers and diplomats should work together in war. It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General\\nPetraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in\\nnegotiations between President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.Before General\\nPetraeus\\'s arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several forceful, ambitious\\npersonalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, as one\\nsaid, \"there are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team.\" But the White House believes that the\\ncurrent lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up has\\nreverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador\\nEikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to the\\ncurrent lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.\"You can\\'t have a major shift in a civ-mil\\nstructure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything,\" said a senior State Department\\nofficial, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by\\nthe Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military\\neffort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in\\nBrussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.\"Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,\" General\\nPetraeus said in an interview. \"We have had, and do have, a very good relationship.\" That role, he said, will now fall to\\nAmbassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon\\'s proposal last year to send 60,000\\nadditional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General\\nPetraeus was the true architect of the plan.The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in\\nAfghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at\\nthe academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador\\nEikenberry has master\\'s degrees from Harvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together, their careers\\nintersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was\\ncommanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General\\nPetraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues,\\nwhile Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of\\nthe George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, the new\\nlandscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, when\\nhis ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a\\ndeputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the\\nembassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke\\'s current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit.\\nHe is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an\\neconomy.These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies\\nwhile seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35\\ncountries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government\\'s campaign to\\nreintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzai\\'s longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders,\\nand his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become\\nmore serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke\\'s negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of\\nAmerican interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeus\\'s influence, he will do most of the shuttling\\nbetween Kabul and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai\\nand with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke\\'s past run-ins\\nwith Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials\\nsaid they trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan\\'s ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to\\nunderstand Pakistan\\'s concerns. \"Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even\\nby those who may not like him,\" Mr. Haqqani said.Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has\\nwasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said,\\nGeneral Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply\\nmore electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. Holbrooke and\\nAmbassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.This is the paper - see below.\\ncdmMS, when you ready, we have three calls that are pending from the last 60/90 minutes — Jones (unsecure), Cheryl and\\nMullen (secure).\\nJake recommends speaking to Cheryl first.\\nLona Valmoro\\nSpecial Assistant to the Secretary of State\\n(direct) B6fyiFyiYepPis raise Afghan women\\'s participation in the London meeting.

I\\'m at the end of week-long trip to Kampala, Kinshasa and now Nairobi. The trip has been very\\nproductive and I will fill you in on some of the discussions I have been having when I return. In the meantime, I know\\nthat there are a number of discussions with Dan Benjamin and others relating to a new more aggressive approach to\\nCVE and I wanted to update you on my thoughts in terms of how those critical discussions fit in with our overall\\napproach to strategic communications around the globe.\\nAs you and I have discussed, it is essential that we become much more pro-active in all our communications efforts. To\\nput it bluntly, we are in an \"information war\" on all fronts. With the proliferation of media outlets and opportunities\\naround the world, we must fight aggressively to get, and maintain, our fair share of \"consumer share of mind.\" Both our\\nadversaries and allies recognize the importance of this aspect of foreign policy and are adopting new ways of\\ncommunicating with foreign publics. Consumers everywhere are constantly facing a barrage of information and in some\\ncases misinformation and dis-information. In order to get our messages across and confront the threats posed by our\\nadversaries, we must develop a new sense of urgency in all our communications efforts. Much has been said and written\\nabout the concept of \"soldier diplomats\". In the same vein, I believe we must empower a corps of \"diplomat soldiers\" to\\nhelp us gain ground in this new war.\\nWhile countering violent extremism is, and will remain, a key objective of our communications efforts we must apply the\\nsame level of determination with respect to all communications. We must both aggressively promote positive stories\\nabout the US and rapidly respond to attacks against us. In the past, our failure to respond to attacks and distortions has\\ndiminished our credibility and undermined our ability to combat our adversaries. For example, had we not responded to\\nall the rumors and innuendos surrounding our relief efforts in Haiti, I believe we would have provided a fertile field for\\nAQ and others to continue to perpetuate the image of the US as an \"invader\".\\nBefore I left for this trip, I convened a meeting of our top PD officers and told them that we must become much more\\naggressive in our strategic communications programs and initiatives. We plan to implement daily calls between our new\\nregional PD DAS\\'s and PAO\\'s in the regions so we can monitor on a daily basis all stories about the USG. We will work\\nwith the Posts to ensure that they have strategies for dealing with stories as they develop. I would also like to request\\nthat you send a cable to all Chiefs of Mission informing of the new strategy and reminding them of their responsibilities\\nin this critical area. We will work on a draft for your review when you return.\\nFinally, we are developing new organizational solutions, modeled on an approach I saw at our Mission in Uganda, which\\nI think will greatly clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to in country communications not only within the\\nMission, but across all government agencies within particular countries.\\nI will continue to update you as we move forward.\\nHope your trip is going well. Look forward to greeting together when we are both back in DC.\\nJMfyiniceAt the foot of the master.\\nI learned.\\ncdmFyi, a bit of Congressipnal outreach.\\nJmFYI we are putting out the following statement.\\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON\\nBombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore\\nI was shocked and saddened by yesterday\\'s attack on one of Pakistan\\'s most popular places of worship, the Shrine of\\nSyed All Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.\\nThe extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani\\nsociety. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to\\nintimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.\\nWe condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend\\ntheir democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it.

V5-\\nrvi,-\\n,\\n,\\nc.:! (by which I mean today\\'s lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court\\nruline\\n;that removes limits from direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that\\nwill have big ripple effects. i mean SecState Hillary Clinton\\'s speech this morning about \"Internet Freedom,\" mentioned\\n;:lere and with a prelude discussion\\nI\\'m not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, lette, or\\nwatching the official video, .\\'tere. And for now some of the main points while listening (and noting main points down in real\\ntime with the handy \\'\\nuiveaSccibe, pen.)\\n- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I\\'m not naming names, but I remember! -- when\\nmany people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together, Clinton\\nstarted off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and is already\\nbeing used in both helpful and destructive ways:\\n\"Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not\\nan unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political\\nrights. Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize\\na city or destroy it, modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for\\ngood or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to\\nspew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open up\\naccess to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent\\nand deny human rights.\"\\nAnd a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it\\'s so blunt and plain:\\n\"On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the\\nUnited States does.\"\\n- Underscoring the \"this is a big deal\" tone of the speech, she enumerated the \"Four Freedoms\" that FDR proclaimed in\\n1941, as part of the struggle for the world\\'s future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the\\nInternet age. Check out the speech yourself for details.\\n- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I\\nexpected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an\\nitemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:\\n\"In the last year, we\\'ve seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and\\nUzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social\\nnetworking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were\\ndetained.\"\\nTunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent\\nsense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;\\novertaking japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations.., all that is one thing.\\nBracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don\\'t appear in formal, big-\\ndeal SecState addresses by accident.\\nOther passages to the same effect:\\n\"As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from\\nthe records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....\\n\"Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy,\\nour government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face\\nconsequences and international condemnation....\"\\nAnd then the Google section itself.\\nI had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main\\nargument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company\\'s ongoing efforts to find a\\n\"il\\nlvineyiftaiv_in\" acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, its not necessarily a help\\nto have the U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant:\\nas a proxy for China\\'s own ability to H.to,tentiai and sustain its economic rise:\\n\"To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an\\nenvironment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If\\ncorporate decision makers don\\'t have access to global sources of news and information, investors will\\nhave less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and information\\nmust recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is no distinction between censoring political\\nspeech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type of\\ninformation, it will inevitably impact on growth.\\n\"Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater\\nconsideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay\\nclose attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of\\ninterest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that\\nled Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be\\ntransparent.\\n\"The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are\\nso many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the\\nbasic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the\\nUnited States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences\\ncandidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.\"\\nThere\\'s a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it\\'s there for the reading.\\nBack to the to-do list for me now.\\nPeirmalink\\n.Share ThisMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nThursday, January 21, 2010 11:23 PM\\nValmoro, Lona J; Abedin, Huma\\nFW: Dartmouth\\nYou are getting a memo on universities.\\nFYI on this from Jim KimHuma Abedin\\nFriday, January 22, 2010 7:36 AM\\nH; \\'ValmoroU@state.gov.\\nRe: Commencements\\nYes we agree\\nLona wanted to make sure you knew what was out there in case\\nare one or 2 we want: to discuss with u.\\nThereExactly -- in case you wanted to factor any into May/June planning.\\nLona Valmoro\\nt to the Secretary of State\\n(direct) B68:25 am PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFING\\n8:30 am Secretary\\'s Office\\n8:30 am DAILY SMALL STAFF MEETING\\n8:45 am Secretary\\'s Office\\n8:45 am DAILY SENIOR STAFF MEETING\\n9:15 am Secretary\\'s Conference Room\\n9:15 am WEEKLY MEETING w/REGIONAL BUREAU SECRETARIES\\n10:00 am Deputy Secretary\\'s Conference Room\\n10:15 am MEETING w/S&ED TEAM\\n10:45 am Secretary\\'s Outer Office\\n10:45 am STAFF MEETING\\n11:15am Secretary\\'s Outer Office\\n11:15 am OFFICE TIME\\n12:00 pm Secretary\\'s Office\\n12:00 pm BILATERAL w/MOLDOVAN PM VLADIMIR FILAT\\n12:30 pm Secretary\\'s Conference Room *Official photo in East Hall preceding.\\n12:30 pm MCC SIGNING CEREMONY w/GOVERNMENT OF MOLDOVA\\n12:50 pm Benjamin Franklin Room, 8th Floor\\n1:00 pm MEETING w/HAITI TEAM\\n1:30 pm Secretary\\'s Office\\n1:30pm OFFICE TIME\\n2:00pm Secretary\\'s Office\\n2:00 pm REMARKS TO THE WHA CHIEFS OF MISSION CONFERENCE\\n2:30 pm George C.

Federal Elections Commission, the landmark case that\\nallows corporations and unions to spend limitless amounts of money on presidential and congressional political\\ncampaigns. A majority of large businesses are now owned by foreign entities, and this means international corporations\\ncould pour tons of money into the United States political scene, potentially swaying the political climate.\\nThe biggest questions with this ruling is the scope of the term \"corporation,\" says Edward Foley, law professor at the Ohio\\nState University College of Law and director of the election-law program. Does the high court want this decision to apply\\nto foreign corporations as well as domestic ones, he ponders? The truth is, the court didn\\'t make a decision one way or\\nthe other.\\nFoley best explains the potential issues by talking about the electronic, video, and communication giant, Sony. The\\ncorporation is headquartered in Japan, but a large number of its shareholders reside in the United States. In fact, people\\ncan even buy and trade Sony\\'s stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The issue is whether this corporation, with strong\\nties to a foreign country and the United States, should be permitted to independently contribute money to presidential and\\ncongressional campaigns.\\nThe court sought to expand First Amendment protection for corporations, but did it really mean to promote the free flow of\\nideas from Russian or Chinese corporations, Foley asks? Justice John Pau! Stevens focused on the same concerns in his\\ndissenting opinion. The majority\\'s position \"would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations\\ncontrolled by foreigners as to individual Americans,\" he writes.\\nThis afternoon, President Obama asked Congress to \"develop a forceful response\" to the ruling. But with Congress\\njuggling so many other important issues, it\\'s unlikely that a change will be made in the immediate future. This could mean\\nthat foreign cash could be supporting political candidates in next year\\'s congressional midterm elections.I am traveling overseas and only have sporadic access to my email.

Even before the earthquake, there were in Haiti up to 300,000 restaveks\\n(children given away or sold by their parents and enslaved as domestic servants), as well as\\nreports that members of MINUSTAH used trafficked women in prostitution. In the 2009 TIP\\nReport Haiti was classified as a Special Case country with governance so dysfunctional it could\\nnot be ranked.\\nThe initial disaster response is focusing on immediate needs of food, shelter, and medical\\ncare, but has thus far not addressed TIP prevention and protection issues. While attention is\\nbeing paid to the problems of orphans and adoptees, TIP was not adequately addressed in the\\nUN\\'s initial flash appeal, so it is unclear which agency in the international system has the lead\\non the ground. UNICEF has the child protection lead, UNFPA leads prevention of sexual and\\ngender-based violence, and IOM is tasked with shelter and camp management. We will work to\\nremedy, in a subsequent appeal, the omission of TIP from the operational plan.\\nWe are moving to redirect $1 million of program funds that G/TIP has on Hispaniola and to\\nreprogram an additional $550,000; we will work with PRM to identify other funding\\npossibilities. Working through existing grantees and other experienced NG0s, it is our\\nintention to help resuscitate police child protection brigades that already exist in Haiti, to\\nrebuild capacity of Haitian organizations that protect restaveks, to prevent traffickers in the\\nDominican Republic from enslaving displaced Haitians on farms and in prostitution, and to\\neducate Haitian parents of the risks of giving their children away in this time of crisis. We will\\nconsult with partner agencies to ensure that the U.S. presence does not contribute to\\ntrafficking. It will be important for the Department\\'s messaging to convey our commitment to\\nfighting human trafficking in both the immediate and long term.\\nSENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIEDAll:\\nSee below for appreciation for all your efforts — congrats and thanks.\\nPlease pass along to whomever I missed.\\ncdmFYINo problemsbwhoeop\\nSaturday, January 23, 2010 9:26 AM\\nH: FYI: Any foreign nation or leader with a front company becomes a \"person\" under US\\nlaw.

The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees,\\nand immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated\\nresponse. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by\\na more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth\\nsector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with\\nconsiderable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR was\\nconsultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was\\npresented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.\\n2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set to\\nsix months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run for\\nabout 21 months, through December 2006, and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through\\nDecember 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.\\n3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency\\ninfrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restore\\nservices to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma\\ntreatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction is to rebuild\\nthe region: rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation,\\ntelecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.\\n4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself, the\\nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end April\\n2005 and became operational early May. The World Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally established\\nthe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civil\\nsociety. Having a credible local coordinators was key to success.\\n5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from the\\nUS goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin\\nwith even slower. By October 2005, project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, but\\nonly USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delay\\nwas caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the\\nexact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding\\nformal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of\\nslightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and\\nimplementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be\\nimplemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.\\n6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have\\nown capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assume\\nfiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that\\nthe funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-\\nfor administrative services. However, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large and\\nto some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues.\\n7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk\\nshows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as\\nwell as a telephone hotline.\\n8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thus\\nan entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.\\n9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions — though it does allow for\\npreference indications — it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the\\ncriteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as the\\nmost successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been\\ncriticized for a lack of coordination. The MDF\\'s Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the\\nMDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness\\nand efficiency of the reconstruction effort.\\n10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy.\\nThe MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response.US law. S\\nThis is from Justice Stevens\\' dissent in the Citizens United case:\\nIf taken seriously, our colleagues\\' assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government\\'s ability\\nto regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the\\npropaganda broadcasts to our troops by \"Tokyo Rose\" during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied\\ncommanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by\\nforeigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could \" \\'enhance the relative voice\\' \"of some ( i.e. ,\\nhumans) over others ( i.e. , nonhurnans).

Forsell took a series of photos at Har\\nHoma, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing\\nconstruction of hundreds of new settlement units — documents of the settlement freeze sham.\\n0\\nNetanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after he\\nannounced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a false\\ndistinction between the West Bank and \"parts of Jerusalem\" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli\\ngovernment flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009, \"We\\'ve made a clear distinction between the West Bank and\\nJerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such.\" With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to go\\nforward.\\nAccording to the Washington Post, Obama\\'s meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring\\nJewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post\\'s Anne Kornblut reported,\\n\"The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of a\\nmoratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September.\" This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it was\\nonly an illusion after all.FYIDelivery has failed to these recipients or distribution lists:\\nscwarzericpOstate.gov\\nThe recipient\\'s e-mail address was not found in the recipient\\'s e-mail system.

Axelrod knows nothing about this, and worse, Emanuel thinks he does because he lived in Israel. Was George\\nMitchell, the president\\'s Mideast negotiator, the brains behind the foolishness? Surely, he\\'s had enough experience\\nworking with Israelis to know better. Did General James Jones, the National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And of\\ncourse, where was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Strangely for someone so adept at pleasing Israel\\'s constituents in\\nAmerica, she spent a lot of time this past year publicly beating up on Israeli leaders. Has she been led astray by the pro-\\nArab contingent of the State Department?\\n•Martin Indyk: New Hope for Mideast Peace\\n•Peter Beinart: Netanyahu\\'s Latest Insult Or is the guilty party none other than President Obama himself? The more we\\nfind out about who makes decisions in the White House on every subject from nuclear weapons to coloring of Easter\\neggs, it turns out to be the man in the Oval Office himself. He\\'s the expert. He\\'s the decider. He invites everyone to state\\nhis or her piece or peace, then he tells them what to do — and seemingly without question, they do his bidding.\\nMr. Obama started his White House tenure from a near-zero base of foreign policy knowledge and no experience in the\\nMiddle East. It was easy enough to guess this blissful state from his earliest decisions. He came out of the box demanding\\nthat Israel agree to suspend construction on the West Bank as a precondition for direct negotiations with the Palestinians.\\nAnyone who knew anything about this situation surely would have told the president that the chances of Mr. Netanyahu\\nagreeing to this \"proposal\" were zero, or minus zero. No Israeli leader, even a dovish one, would ever dream of beginning\\nnegotiations by conceding his major bargaining card. As the teenagers say, what were Obama and his advisers thinking?\\nAnd yes, after the Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden during his trip to the Holy Land by announcing they\\nwould start new construction in East Jerusalem, Washington had to respond vehemently. The Israelis had been arrogant\\nand stupid on this one. They had weakened American power in the region. No U.S. president could let them get away with\\nit. Clinton and others made strong public statements of criticism, and those were fine. But Mr. Obama then allowed Mr.\\nNetanyahu to come ahead with his planned visit to D.C. — and publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let the Israeli\\nprime minister cool his heels for hours before meeting with him, then wouldn\\'t shake his hand when he departed. There\\'s\\nno surer way to unite a nation behind its leader, even a controversial one like Netanyahu, than to have a foreign leader\\nhumiliate him.\\nThis brilliant tactic — thought of by Obama\\'s advisers or the president himself — accomplished two things. It stiffened Israeli\\nbacks even further against being conciliatory about starting talks with the Palestinians. The Israeli government was not\\nabout to cave to American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters in the United States — in particular within\\nconservative parts of the Jewish community and the Republican Party. There went Mr. Obama\\'s support for pressing\\nIsrael even in private.\\nTo top this all off with Tuesday\\'s meeting, full of smiles and the adoption of Israeli-desired language on almost every topic,\\nonly made matters worse. It made the situation look as if the American president had been cowed by Jewish control of\\n. .\\nAmerican politics. That certainly pleased American and Israeli hawks, but it did not please others who want to see\\ngenuine progress in Mideast talks.\\nThere is a time and place for Washington to put pressure on Israel. Mr. Obama and his team picked every wrong time and\\nplace. The right occasion to squeeze is when the negotiations have reached the point where both sides have given and\\nwhere both must give more to close the deal. Only at that point does pressure make sense. All parties would get a real\\nshot at peace in return for their concessions.\\nTo be sure, many ask at this point — How do you get to that point? The answer is not to browbeat the parties to scurry to\\nthe negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer is to build conditions beyond the negotiating table,\\nconditions in the political community in both Israel and Palestine, that would support compromises at the table. The British\\'\\npushed the Catholics and Protestants to make concessions year after year, only to fail time and again, only to further\\ninflame feelings all around and spur greater violence. Finally, London focused on getting Protestant and Catholic women\\nto form common groups to support compromise. London did as much with various business communities that evolved into\\nbackers of mutual concessions as well. Only then did parties know that they had support for compromises, their\\nnegotiations got somewhere, and they reached agreement. That\\'s what needs to be done between Israel and the\\nPalestinians.\\nWe hear time and again that the enemy of peace in the Middle East is time, and that time is running out. Perhaps that is\\nwhat has caused Mr. Obama and his team to misstep so badly; they think it\\'s a race against the clock. Do something now\\nor fail. But the real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it\\'s failure. Neither Israel nor the\\nPalestinians nor the United States can afford to fail again. After yet another failure, it could well result in perpetual\\nviolence.\\nTo set his Arab-Israeli policy on a sensible course, Mr. Obama needs to search for new advisors who know how to get\\nthings done in the Middle East, hire them, and listen to them.\\nLeslie H.

Sid\\nBelow is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. Here\\'s a\\nsummary:\\n1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza;\\n2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving;\\n3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla;\\n4. 20% of Americans \"felt support\" for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure.\\nFrank Luntz analyses Netanyahu\\'s media performance in the flotilla affair\\nThe figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US, it is easy to imagine the\\nsituation in other, somewhat less sympathetic countries.\\nChannel Ten TV News, July 1 2010 20:38\\nYaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation in\\nthe world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him.\\nNetanyahu\\'s messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe has\\nobtained the report.\\nChico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu\\'s current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from the\\ninternational elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz, considered one of the leading\\nAmerican political consultants, a Republican pollster, a consultant to many governments throughout the world and to\\ndozens of the biggest corporations in the US. He was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check the\\nopinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The result\\nis a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israel\\'s number one\\npropagandist in the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu.\\nNetanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.\\nChico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with accusing the international community, writes Luntz, they\\nlose their audience. For example, Netanyahu\\'s comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected by\\nmost of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members of\\nNetanyahu\\'s Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups, not a poll. He warns of a dangerous slide in the\\npublic opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli, the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change world\\npublic opinion, he writes, and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to accept\\narguments that support Israeli positions.\\nEhud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis.\\nNetanyahu: There\\'s no shortage of food, there\\'s no shortage of medicine, there\\'s no shortage of other goods.\\nChico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and no\\nhumanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says this fatally destroys Israel\\'s credibility in light of the images on the\\ntelevision screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem, he says, to gain the listeners\\' sympathy [emphasis\\nmine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in\\nGaza, and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people in\\nGaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israel\\'s image missed the opportunity,\\naccording to Luntz.\\nNetanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear. On the one hand,\\nallowing civilian goods into Gaza, and on the other hand maintaining the military blockade of Hamas.\\nChico Menashe: The statement by Netanyahu\\'s bureau of lifting the closure missed the opportunity to gain\\nsupport in international public opinion [emphasis mine]. Only 20% of the Americans polled felt support of Israel\\nfollowing the statement. According to Lunt, this is the summary of the flotilla damage in American public opinion: Only\\n34% of the American public support the Israeli operation against the flotilla, and he says that is a dangerously low\\npercentage.Ms: dep. steinberg has put in a request through ops to speak with you. He says it can be unsecure.\\n###Fyi - we are putting out the following today.Ms:\\nI apologize if this email is duplicating anyone else\\'s efforts (we are trying to leave huma alone today!)

In addition, almost 6 in 10 respondents say the war in\\nAfghanistan is a lost cause.\\nAlmost two-thirds say they feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction, an even more sour\\nassessment than in March when 58 percent felt that way. Two-thirds of independent voters are\\npessimistic, while just 56 percent of Democrats offer a vote of confidence.\\n\"They don\\'t see any solutions in sight,\" said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa-\\nbased firm that conducted the nationwide survey. \"They have been hammered by the economy and there\\nis a disconnect between the lives Americans are living and Washington. They seem to have lost hope.\"\\nPoll respondents are divided on their congressional preference between Democrats and Republicans,\\nwith both sides getting 43 percent support. Among those who say they are most likely to vote,\\nRepublicans are favored, 48 percent to 40 percent. The Republican advantage is even greater among\\nlikely voters who view the election as exceptionally important, with Republicans beating Democrats 56\\npercent to 34 percent.\\nControl of Congress\\nFor the Democrats, whd control Congress and the White House, the survey shows the potential \\'for losses\\nin November, when voters will fill all 435 House seats, 36 Senate seats and 37 governorships. The\\noutcome could affect °Pam\\'s ability to move his agenda through Congress for the two years leading up\\nto his own 2012 re-election bid.\\nThe fate of incumbents will depend to some extent on what happens to the economy in the next four\\nmonths and whether unemployment drops much from its current 9.5 percent. A rising stock market could\\nhelp as well. So far this year, the S&P 500 stock index has declined 1.8 percent.\\nThe public\\'s disenchantment with the president\\'s Policies doesn\\'t extend to voter feelings about Obama\\nhimself, as he gets a job approval rating of 52 percent and personally is viewed favorably by 55 percent.\\nObama, 48, remains more popular than any of the Republican figures tested in the poll and is topped only\\nby Secretary of State :-- ;:!aity ant.cn and General Da,,,td Petraeos, the new commander of U.S. forces in\\nAfghanistan, among a list of 15 people and political parties reviewed.\\nRepublican Leaders\\nThe only bright spot for Republican candidates is for Louisiana Governor Eiob%) 1i:tele!, who gets a 32\\npercent favorable rating and an 18 percent unfavorable grade. Better-known party leaders such as former\\nvice presidential candidate :a-et..n and former House Speaker Netf,ri: CirigPait both have negative\\nratings that outweigh the positive views.\\nAlthough turnout in midterm elections is historically lower than in presidential races, the electorate is\\ninterested. Four- fifths of Americans who plan to vote say November\\'s election is very or exceptionally\\nimportant.\\nThe likelihood to vote is strongest among older voters, Republicans and those with the highest incomes.\\nAmong those 55 and older. three-quarters say they will definitely vote, compared with 48 percent of those\\nyounger than 35. Four-fifths of Republicans say they will definitely vote, compared with 65 percent of\\nDemocrats and 62 percent of independents.\\nReferendum on °barna\\nSeeking to capitalize on the intensity expressed by voters, Republicans want to make the election a\\nnational referendum on Obama and the party in power, while the White House and Democrats argue it is\\nabout going forward, rather than backward to failed policies.\\nThe challenge for Democrats will be to translate their vision of a better future into more positive feelings\\nabout the economy among voters. In the poll, Republicans have the advantage among the independents\\noften critical to winning elections. Among independents likely to vote, Republican congressional\\ncandidates are preferred to Democrats, 50 percent to 29 percent.\\n\"Anything that has been tried hasn\\'t resulted in making anything better in the world where ordinary people\\nlive,\" Selzer said. \"That\\'s a bad scenario for incumbents of the majority party.\"\\nIncumbent Disadvantage\\nA third of poll participants say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who has served in\\nCongress for many years. About one-fifth of likely voters say the election is more about sending a\\nmessage, while three-quarters say it is about picking the party that has the best ideas.\\n\"I don\\'t know what these people are thinking in Washington,\" says poll respondent Jeff Lockman, 41, a\\nprofessional golfer and Republican from Malvern, Pennsylvania. \"They are going in 10 different directions\\nand they really don\\'t know what to focus on.\"\\nThe proportion who feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction is about the same as at this poin\\'t in\\n1994, when Republicans took control of Congress, and 2006, when Democrats took over.\\nThe public also has soured on Obama\\'s foreign-policy priority, the war in Afghanistan. While the president\\nhas ordered an expansion of forces to turn the tide in a conflict where he says the U.S. has a critical stake,\\n58 percent say it is a lost cause, compared with 36 percent who say it can still be won. A slim majority of\\nRepublicans -- 52 percent -- say the U.S. can still win in Afghanistan, while 71 percent of Democrats say\\nthe conflict is lost.\\nAfghanistan Withdrawal\\nSix in 10 Americans say it would be best to stick with Obarna\\'s plan to start withdrawing forces in July\\n2011, while one-third say they remain open to keeping the same number of troops there, or even adding\\nadditional forces.\\nReflecting the belief among many that the war cannot be won, a third of Americans say they have become\\nless supportive of the effort there in recent months.\\nThe Bloomberg National Poll is based on interviews with 1,004 U.S. adults ages 18 or older. Percentages\\nbased on the full sample may have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\\n:4:?,r;yr• \\'.\\n3cwrra:1, who studies public opinion at the ,A;-necicar Entarpr:F.:e institute, a public-policy research\\ngroup in Washington, cails the poll \"very, very grim news for the Democrats.\"\\nAt the same time, she says, one silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans have yet to convince\\nvoters that they have a plan.\\nObarna Visit\\nOne signpost for Democrats in the poll is the finding that just 26 percent of Americans say it would help a\\nDemocratic candidate in their area to get a visit from Obama, while 20 percent say it would hurt the\\ncandidate and 54 percent say it wouldn\\'t matter or they don\\'t know.\\nObama\\'s worst ratings are for his handling of the budget deficit, where 59 percent disapprove and 37\\npercent approve. It\\'s his worst grade for that subject in any of four Bloomberg polls taken since\\nSeptember 2009. The Obama administration expects a record budget deficit this year of more than $1.5\\ntrillion, or 10.6 percent of GDP, according to projections the White House released in February. It was\\n$1.4 trillion for the 2008-2009 fiscal year, which covers the end ofGecrge W. Bush\\'s presidency, and\\nObama has said that the current fiscal shortfall as well as theunemployment rate are inheritances from his\\nRepublican predecessor\\'s administration.\\n\"My biggest fear is we have people in government who don\\'t have a clue about what is going on in the\\neconomy,\" says poll respondent Jim Heeter, 66, from Glendale, Arizona. \"They have never run a business\\nor had to make a payroll.\"\\nEconomy, Health Care\\nSlim majorities disapprove of Obama\\'s handling of the economy and health care. When it comes to\\ncreating jobs, he gets 46 percent approval, addressing problems on Wall Street, 42 percent support,\\nrunning the war in Afghanistan, 46 percent approve, and managing the BP Plc oil spill, 46 percent\\nsupport.\\nForty-five percent say they have become more supportive in recent months of tougher regulations for Wall\\nStreet. The momentum is heading in the opposite direction from the White House and Democrats on most\\nother issues.\\nAlmost half say they have become less supportive in recent months of federal money being loaned to\\nautomotive companies to help them stay in business, while 37 percent have become less supportive of\\nthe health-care overhaul passed by Congress earlier this year. A majority, 61 percent, say the nation\\nshould wait and see how the health-care legislation works or leave it alone, while 37 percent want to see it\\nrepealed.\\nArizona Immigration Law\\nAlmost half of Americans say they have also grown more supportive of allowing local law enforcement to\\ndetain anyone who can\\'t produce proof of citizenship when stopped for an offense, as is contemplated in\\nan Arizona law. Cbama has criticized the measure and the Justice Department has announced it plans to\\nsue Arizona.\\nAt least half of respondents also say they would be less likely to support candidates who voted to give\\nfinancial assistance to the banking or automobile industries.\\nAmericans are roughly divided on whether they would be more or less likely to support a candidate who\\nvoted against extending unemployment benefits because of concern over the cost. A measure providing\\nsuch support worth $34 billion is stalled in Congress.\\nClinton Popularity\\nThe disaffection with Obarna and Democrats doesn\\'t carry over to all Democrats. Hillary Clinton, 62, is\\nviewed favorably by 61 percent of respondents and a quarter of Americans, including 30 percent of\\nRepublicans and 21 percent of Democrats, say the nation would be in a better place if she had been\\nelected president.\\nThe Tea Party movement, which has been mainly associated with Republicans, has lukewarm support in\\nthe poll. A majority of 58 percent of all respondents says it would make no difference to them if a\\ncandidate was backed by Tea Party activists, while a third of Republicans say that kind of backing would\\nmake a candidate more appealing to them.\\nThose who are more likely to think the Tea Party is a simplistic and misguided movement -- 44 percent of\\nall respondents -- include Democrats, 65 percent, and those with the highest incomes, 52 percent.\\nIndependent voters are divided on whether it is misguided or has rightly identified that the nation would be\\nbetter served by reduced federal government, compared with 39 percent overall.SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN\\nThe Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military\\noperation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts\\nwhich resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their\\nfamilies. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The\\nCouncil urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and\\nwounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The\\nSecurity Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into\\nthe matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international\\nstandards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the\\nimportance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at\\nthe humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as\\nwell as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council\\nunderscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties\\nand re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in\\npeace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses\\nsupport for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway\\nand urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners\\nto promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.YesI am on travel and will not return to the office until the afternoon of June 1.

SCA favors\\nproviding more USG support for AUCA\\nSince 9/11 the United States has provided more than $15 million to AUCA in support of its endowment and various\\nother initiatives. For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars\\nprovided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in\\n2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to\\nthe AUCA president on accreditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds for\\nstudents from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university.\\nSoros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and his\\nfoundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and they\\nhave been discussing the issue with Soros\\' staff.\\nA little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA: The university has made significant progress this year on a\\nnumber of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia, a place where students are judged solely\\non merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking. The university achieved an important milestone this year\\nrelated to its U.S. accreditation, signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next May\\nwill receive full diplomas from Bard College, an institution accredited in the United States. In addition, AUCA recently\\nestablished a new partnership with the American University in Kabul facilitated through state of the art video classroom\\ntechnology and recently announced the appointment of Andrew Wachtel, from Northwestern University, as the new\\nAUCA president who will take office this summer.\\nI will include this note (in addition to Soros\\' letter) in your materials for your meeting with Soros tomorrow.

It was a blunder.\" Talleyrand.Gaza: it\\'s Hamas\\'s move now\\nHamas must seize the initiative if there is ever to be an end to Israel\\'s occupation of Palestine\\n•\\n•\\nc) Jeremy Greenstock\\no quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST\\nSo it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building\\nmaterials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.\\nThe UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be\\nheld to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to\\nprevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?\\nA commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the\\nemotions behind all this.\\nWhy is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for\\nthe proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a\\ntraumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They\\nare also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida\\'s ground.\\nThe director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled \"Illegal, inhuman. and\\ninsane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010\". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israel,\\nthe only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim to\\ninternational legitimacy in its handling of this situation?\\nHamas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past\\n17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectly\\nperhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gaza\\nbombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006\\nand claim to respect democracy. Let\\'s test them on that. At present, Hamas security people are being sniped at by the\\nIsraeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane.\\nThe unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the West\\nBank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own direct\\nexperience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the\\nthreat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish two\\nstates in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law.\\nThe distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good.\\nIf a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end the\\nblockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated that\\nthey could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza if\\nthe blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt.\\nThe Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah in\\nthe West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make a\\nmuch more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own political\\ncomfort.\\nWe are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, is\\nlocked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel is\\nconfident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated.\\nBut that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today\\'s\\nworld, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, and\\nlegitimacy breeds support.\\nIsrael\\'s relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond\\nthe west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part of\\nits population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for.\\nI hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel\\'s discomfiture. They have so far, for a political organisation, attracted\\nmuch too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner, they must\\nunequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence —\\nunderline that their objective is a two-state settlement, and win international friends for the ending of the occupation. In\\nwhoever\\'s hands, bombs, bullets, rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will.\\n•This article was originally written for the Times but not publishedFYI:\\nUSIBC Launches New Education Initiative to Strengthen K-12, Vocational, and Higher Education Linkages in the U.S. and\\nIndia\\nJune 2, 2010 - Washington, DC - On the occasion of its 35th anniversary, and looking ahead to the global economy of\\nthe future, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) today announced the launch of a new initiative aimed at\\nstrengthening institutional linkages between academia, industry and NGOs focusing on the elementary, vocational and\\nhigher education sectors in both countries.\\n\"The United States and India must be committed partners in building the workforce of tomorrow, a partnership that will\\nunleash opportunity, spur growth and sustain prosperity not just in our countries but across the global community,\" said\\nHarold McGraw III, incoming USIBC Chairman and Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. \"To do\\nthis, we must focus on strengthening our educational ties at every level. By working together our two countries can\\nequip the next generation with the education and skills necessary to compete and win in the global economy.\"\\nMr. McGraw gave the keynote address before a packed audience of over 400 U.S. and Indian business, government, and\\neducation leaders at USIBC\\'s 35th Anniversary Summit, entitled \"A Pivotal Period in U.S.-India Relations: Tackling\\nEducation, Infrastructure and Inclusive Growth.\"\\nOn the eve of the first-ever U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue, India\\'s Union Minister of External Affairs, SM Krishna, U.S.\\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan, India\\'s Minister of Human Resource Development, Kapil Sibal, and India\\'s Ambassador\\nto the United States, Meera Shankar, joined hundreds of top business leaders in Washington to participate in the U.S.-\\nIndia Business Council 35th anniversary deliberations.\\nUSIBC\\'s Education Initiative will serve as a dynamic platform for business, NGOs, and academia to provide vital input into\\nboth the U.S. and Indian governments - such that the synergies between American and Indian business and educational\\ncommunities are unleashed.\\n\"We can talk about strategic, defense, civil nuclear, renewable energy and every other type of commercial cooperation,\\nbut if we do not develop the skill sets in our respective societies to sustain such collaboration, all this talk will never be\\nsuccessfully converted to action,\" Ron Somers, President of the U.S.-India Business Council, noted. \"How fortunate it is\\nthat families across all walks of life in both our societies so highly value education. We have much to learn from one\\nanother, and much to accomplish - to prepare for the challenges of the 21st Century,\" Somers said.\\nThe USIBC Education initiative will focus on three thrust areas:\\n1. Higher Education: USIBC will host the U.S.-India Higher Education Forum (HEF) at the invitation of the U.S. and\\nIndian governments. The HEF will serve as the premier platform to enlist academia, industry and NGOs to strengthen\\nlinkages between U.S. and Indian educational institutions from both countries. The HEF will provide a formalized\\nnetwork for industry, academia and the NGO community to provide direct policy input to the U.S. and Indian\\ngovernments in all areas of education, with an aim to facilitate greater collaboration, including the opening of India\\'s\\nhigher education sector.\\n2. Elementary K-12 Education : USIBC has embarked on a survey of rural and urban, private and public K-12 schools\\nthroughout India to identify best practices that are working well in educating students, while assessing needs where\\nindustry, NGOs and government may join together to fill gaps. With the support of Ryan International Group, one of\\nIndia\\'s leading educators, both financial and intellectual resources will be mobilized to transform these and other\\nschools in a manner that promotes replication of successful models across India.\\n3. Vocational Training and Skills Development : USIBC will partner with its member-companies to feature Case\\nStudies of Vocational Training and Skills Development that are being implemented across India. The exercise will\\nattempt to enlist more corporations to participate in this important area of human capacity building. Programs helping\\nto train thousands of workers will generate employment opportunities and sustain economic growth now and for the\\nlong future - in both countries.\\nIndia is embarked on expanding its community college system, including technical training institutions, as well as inviting\\ninterest in implementing 30,000 new colleges and 1,500 universities over the next decade.\\nThe United States continues to be the most sought after destination for Indian students studying overseas, attracting as\\nmany as 113,000 each year to American universities and colleges. The U.S. wishes to remain a magnet for attracting the\\nbest and the brightest from around the world by promoting institutional partnerships between U.S. based educational\\ninstitutions and new counterparts.

Deuel has lived in Arlington Heights, but her heart has resided in Jamal\\nPlace, a three-story graystone at 1335 S. California Ave. in the North Lawndale neighborhood of\\nChicago. As a founder and executive director of Jamal Place, Deuel can tell countless stories about\\nthe boys, ages 11 to 17, who have spent time in the group home and about the army of suburbanites\\nfrom St. Charles, Naperville, Lake Zurich and Lisle who have volunteered, donated and served on the\\nboard to help those kids. Lots of people in that field have good things to say about Deuel and Jamal\\nPlace.\\nBut when the new fiscal year begins on July 1, the Illinois Department of Children and Family\\nServices will not renew its contract with Jamal Place, forcing those kids to go to other facilities.\\n\"To shut us down and deny kids this opportunity is unconscionable,\" says Deuel, as she takes a deep\\nbreath and dabs at her eyes in an attempt to keep her emotions in check.\\nShe and her staff operated last year through a $1,041,000 contract with DCFS to provide a group\\nhome for 10 wards of the state. They\\'ve carved out a wonderful reputation in 15 years, so what\\nhappened?\\nThe easy answer is that DCFS put the group home under a new performance-based contracting\\nsystem that determined Jamal Place fell short of benchmarks for keeping kids from running away,\\nrequiring hospitalization or ending up in juvenile detention.\\n\"Taxpayers expect and deserve positive results in the children we serve,\" says DCFS spokesman\\nKendall Marlowe. Jamal Place simply didn\\'t measure up in the areas the state measures.\\nBecause Illinois has trimmed the number of wards of the state from a high of 52,000 in 1997 to only\\n15,500, a much higher percentage of those kids have mental illnesses, substance abuse or other\\nproblems. Since the state measures an agency\\'s performance by days that the kids are physically\\npresent in the home, Jamal Place, with its small population, got bad marks when a child was\\nhospitalized for a mental-health issue or detained by a judge.\\n\"We did what was clinically advisable for these children and we got dinged for it,\" says Brian Barclay,\\nassistant executive director of Jamal Place. \"We did what was in kids\\' best interest.\"\\nThere is no consideration given for \"incremental improvements in youth behavior, which occur as\\ntrusting relationships develop,\" Deuel notes. \"I wish they could find a way to measure the individual\\naspects.\"\\nWhen compared with similar facilities, Jamal Place graded lower, Marlowe says, adding that it \"isn\\'t a\\nhappy day\" when the state ends an agreement with a facility that has \"good people\" and has done\\n\"good work\" in the past. He says DCFS did renew a contract with Deuel for a different transitional\\nliving facility that serves an older population.\\nOne of Jamal Place\\'s \"unfavorable\" outcomes involves a kid who already had a criminal record when\\nhe came to the group home at age 14. Now 17, he says he ended up in juvenile court after he made a\\nmistake by hanging with the wrong people on the day when he stole a woman\\'s purse.\\n\"I\\'ve got a good relationship with the staff and residents. We did things as a family,\" says the teen,\\nwho now is living with a grandmother. \"I love my grandmother, but I\\'d rather be at Jamal Place. I\\'m\\ntrying to do everything in my power to get back to Jamal Place.\"\\nIntangibles aren\\'t part of the bureaucratic process. There isn\\'t a place on an evaluation form to give\\ncredit to Deuel and her staff for leading the effort that closed a local \"crack house.\" There\\'s no way to\\nmeasure the improvements in a former resident that led him for the first time to sign \"love\" before his\\nname on the Mother\\'s Day card he sent Deuel this year. There\\'s no scoresheet for the local gang\\nleader who stopped preying on Jamal kids when he was confronted by Deuel and recognized her as\\nthe woman who gave him a Christmas present a few years earlier. The interview for this story is\\ninterrupted when that man calls Deuel, who is helping him find a legitimate job.\\n\"It is enormously frustrating to me that the attachment the boys develop with our staff members is not\\na \\'measurable\\' outcome,\" Deuel says. \"These are our children. Long after DCFS is done with these\\nkids, our door is still open.\"\\nLast weekend, many former residents came back to explain how Jamal Place helped them. On June\\n26, Jamal Place will celebrate its 15th anniversary with a picnic and walkathon in Douglas Park,\\nacross the street from the home. Deuel and her staff are hoping DCFS finds a way to give them more\\ntime, another year to continue its mission.\\n\"I\\'ve always maintained that God won\\'t let us fail,\" says Deuel. \"For 15 years, that\\'s been the case,\\nand now we\\'ve got this challenge.\"fyiFYI.7:30 Ukranian Foreign Minister Gryshchenko\\n8 Greek Prime Minister PapandreouAbedin, Huma <AbedinH©state.gov>\\nFriday, June 4, 2010 7:21 AM\\nH\\nFyiI\\'ve already asked him.

This conference is an international gathering that focuses on maternal health and\\nwill include an estimated 3,000 representatives from governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, and the\\nprivate sector. The aim of the conference is to generate political commitment and financial investment for fulfilling\\nMillennium Development Goal 5, which pledges a three-quarter reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to\\nreproductive health by 2015. The conference is one of several international gatherings this year that will include a focus\\non maternal and child health (MCH). As you know, this issue will also feature at the G-8, where the Canadians are\\noffering a flagship initiative on MCH, and at the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September, where the UN\\nSecretary General is sponsoring a Joint Effort on Women and Children\\'s Health. The US will be represented at the\\nWomen Deliver conference by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Undersecretary of State Maria\\nOtero, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, and a host of other USG participants. Please note: You recently recorded a video\\nmessage that will open the conference.\\nThe full script is below.\\nSUGGESTED TALKING POINTS\\n• For too long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result,\\nchildbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. • The United States has elevated the\\nissue of maternal health in our development work through the Global Health Initiative, a $63 billion dollar proposal to\\nhelp countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems and integrated service delivery, with a\\nparticular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. This conference—along with other international\\ngatherings this year, including the G-8 and the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September—presents a unique\\nopportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health. • When women prosper, their families and\\ncommunities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. ADDITIONAL\\nBACKGROUND The theme of this year\\'s Women Deliver conference is \"Delivering Solutions for Girls and Women,\" with a\\nfocus on political, economic, social/cultural, and technological solutions. Conference organizers plan to emphasize the\\nfollowing messages:1) The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved without investing in\\nwomen.2) There is just enough time, if the world commits funding now, to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5—\\nan additional US $10 billion annually by 2010 and US $20 billion by 2015.Women Deliver was launched at a conference\\nin London in 2007. Jill Sheffield is the President of the organization.\\nFINAL VIDEO SCRIPT WOMEN DELIVER CONFERENCEWASHINGTON, DC\\nI am delighted to welcome all of you to this conference and to thank you for the work you are doing to put maternal\\nhealth at the top of our development agenda. Your commitment to this issue has raised awareness and inspired action\\naround the world. We know that women represent our greatest opportunity for progress in this century. If the potential\\nof women is fully developed, everyone benefits. And this can\\'t be done without improving maternal health. But for too\\nlong and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result, childbirth remains\\na leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. The United States has elevated this issue in our development\\nwork through the Global Health Initiative, a 63 billion dollar proposal to help countries improve health outcomes\\nthrough strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. We\\ncommend the Canadian government for focusing much-needed attention to this issue by offering a flagship initiative on\\nmaternal and child health at the upcoming G-8 meeting in Muskoka. The US also congratulates the United Nations\\nSecretary General for convening governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, foundations and corporations to\\nengage in a much-needed global effort to promote women\\'s and children\\'s health. These efforts—and this conference—\\npresent a unique opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health, because when women prosper, their\\nfamilies and communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them.

Lithuania\\nhas the lead for the next two years. They are extremely energetic and recognize that CD needs to be reinvigorated. It\\nwas not given much leadership from us during the Bush years and besides democracy got a bad name — among other\\nreasons. Their plan is to create a few working groups focused on issues that are current and important with specific\\npractical goals and tangible results — among them, one will be focused on women and their critical role. As you know,\\nthey have a female president, the EU has just established a Gender Institute in Vilnius and they remember Vital Voices\\nwhen you headed up the conference in Iceland and the successor conference which was held in Lithuania in 2001. We\\ntalked about a more concerted commitment -- to advocating for women and the role they need to play in conflict\\nresolution (1325), helping women in Afghanistan and working to help women in eastern Europe and the Caucuses where\\nthings appear to be going backwards in many ways (takes me back to our first-ever VV conference in Vienna).\\nI agreed that we would co-chair the gender working group with Lithuania.\\nThe Lithuanians believe that in many ways the younger generation takes for granted what the older generation fought\\nfor (they remember being a \"Captive Nation and how the US kept them going with an embassy when they was little\\nlikelihood at the time that they\\'d ever become a democracy), and that today democracies are struggling in too many\\nplaces. It\\'s as though we have to take back democracy\\'s good name and focus it as a universal value to address the\\ncritical challenges.\\nMike Posner has the lead on CD. I talked to him about all of this. He is all for our doing the gender working group as\\nsomething tangible. He is concerned about where the Community of Democracies goes more broadly. Since this was a\\ncreation of the Clinton Administration and since democracy is under siege in so many places, I hope we will find a way to\\nwork with the Lithuanians and others who still want to see it make a difference. In some ways it may be more relevant\\ntoday. They are planning the first ministerial in Krakow in July and hoping so much that you will be a part of it.\\nAssuming I can get there, I\\'m going to their embassy in the morning where several government reps of participating\\ncountries will be meeting to announce next steps, including the gender working group.RELEASE IN PART\\nB6\\nI drove the roads - I live lots of packed hard snow and two stuck cars.

In war\\nand in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working\\nfamilies struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over\\nthe course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation\\'s most respected voices on national\\nsecurity and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for\\nleadership and wisdom. As Senator from New York serving on the Armed Services Committee, I was fortunate to call\\nJack a friend and mentor. And as Secretary of State, I continued to rely on his expertise and judgment. I knew that Jack\\nwould always shoot straight, like the Marine he was, and never shy away from a difficult question or a tough fight. Today\\nour country has lost a decorated war hero and a distinguished public servant. The men and women of the our armed\\nforces have lost a tireless champion.

Last Thursday Clinton\\ndescribed Mother Teresa \"beaming about what this meant for children and their futures,\" seemingly oblivious that the\\nMother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelessly\\nto \"cut through all the red tape,\" although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. According to a\\npastor at the church next door to the home\\'s former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because the\\nRoman Catholic nuns who ran it weren\\'t allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. \"I\\'m not sure the\\nlegal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way,\" said\\nMaureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshour\\nhas stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining\\nthree or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless.\"This has\\nbeen a core issue—adoption—whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not,\" said Chuck Johnson, chief\\noperating officer of the National Council for Adoption. \"It\\'s an issue she\\'s been consistent on.\"During her speech on\\nThursday, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother\\nTeresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, \"Any country that\\naccepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want.\" Mother Teresa then\\ncalled on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: \"Please don\\'t kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the\\nchild.\"The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not\\nstand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,\\nsitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.\"She told me that she knew that we had a\\nshared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,\" Clinton related last\\nThursday. \"And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babies\\nhere in Washington.\"Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,\\nno small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for\\nInfant Children opened in June 1995 in the district\\'s affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant\\nmothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charity\\nin Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said\\nshe couldn\\'t give her name because they aren\\'t allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who\\nare in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn\\'t sure why it closed. She\\nadded that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. \"We work with the poor and we didn\\'t have any work there\\nbecause it\\'s a rich neighborhood,\" she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with\\nAIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.\\n###I will look into what happened to it after 2002 (LH was released 6/03, so better than 04)See message below from your friend the egyptian foreign minister....fyiFyiIMore details...I suspect they want him in Johnstown, but I will double check.Will doCheckingFyiWelcome back.

The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed\\nstreets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey\\'s end; the spotlight that\\nhas not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most\\nexciting for a generation - had never ended.\\nBut this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton\\'s convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not\\nSouth Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what\\nthe overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might\\nsuggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of\\nUS leadership, one very much built around herself.\\nShe\\'s had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall\\ntonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she\\'s still greeted by a wave of raised\\narms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.\\nIn the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays\\nthat pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while\\nBrazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a\\nborn politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and\\nlocal celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.\\nMost US secretaries of state wouldn\\'t bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it\\nto be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip -\\nand she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed\\nbodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a\\nquarter of a million miles since taking office.\\nOn this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four\\ncountries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a\\nshower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we\\ndon\\'t leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.\\nSo what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,\\ntalking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.\\n\"We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister\\nor the foreign minister or an ambassador,\" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her\\nexpansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. \"People now have a voice and an opinion and a\\nvote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of\\nleadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.\"\\nShe argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US\\'s image in the wake of the Bush administration\\n- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a\\nbattle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is\\nideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the\\nforeign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -\\ngo beyond that.\\nIs she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? \"Well, I think that is part of the job,\" she replies,\\ntoying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. \"If you are making a case for American values and\\nfor American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we\\nhad to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.\"\\nAs in S\\'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - \"I\\'ve been fighting this all day,\" she says as she masks a\\ncough set off by her allergies (Washington\\'s cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still\\nhectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State\\nDepartment are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and\\nunhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as \"oh my gosh\", even as she discusses issues of\\nstate. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe\\'s airspace shutdown and tells me she\\'s\\nbeen talking to Norway\\'s foreign minister about it.\\n\"He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it\\'s chunky! I don\\'t know how\\nelse to describe it,\" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word\\n\"chunky\".\\nClinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner\\nof her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known\\nless for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who\\nretains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying\\nfrom a room.\\nHer staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,\\nand the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.\\nBush\\'s right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most\\nsubstantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who\\nserved as secretary almost a century ago. \"Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential\\nstature, has set her apart,\" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. \"Leaders\\nwant to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.\"\\nState visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S\\'ao Paulo\\nairport in March\\nBack in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of\\ntraditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her\\ndance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous\\nyoung man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,\\nsmiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female\\nstudent asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she\\nemphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if\\ndemonstrating the size of a fish.\\nThen a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into\\ntreacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just\\nexpectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. \"Wealthy women\\nhave rights in every country,\" she says. \"And poor women don\\'t.\" Her strength of feeling can\\'t be hidden\\nas she denounces \"the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise\\nsuch a fundamental personal right\".\\nTom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: \"I understand the possible concern that we\\nmight have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn\\'t laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was\\nsharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state.\" It\\'s true: Clinton\\ndoesn\\'t quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without\\nappearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight\\nahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven\\'t left her. Perhaps it is\\nthe lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the\\npodium at a joint appearance with Argentina\\'s president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her\\nsatisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the\\nstage.\\nYet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her \"almost inhuman loyalty\"\\ntowards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an \"information carnivore\" one of her officials calls her -\\ncomes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the\\nforeign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.\\nIn Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive\\ndiscrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-\\nBrazilians account for more than half the country\\'s population but only 2 per cent of university students.\\n\"That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so\\nthat they can have a chance to succeed,\" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before\\nspeaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She\\nsays: \"The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it\\ndemonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.\"\\nAmong the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It\\'s hard to think of a more fulsome\\nstatement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead\\nand millions of dollars in the struggle against him.\\nThe great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama\\nadministration\\nWhen I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the\\nobedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne \"that\\'s politics\". She adds: \"We\\'re\\nworking really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to\\nme.\" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. \"I always run\\ninclusive and successful organisations,\" she retorts when I ask her whether she\\'d applied any lessons from\\nthat searing experience to her new post.\\nShe admits she didn\\'t want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the\\nSenate -. \"but at the end of the day, I\\'m pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do\\nsomething, you\\'d better have a really good reason why you can\\'t.\" Also, she adds: \"Suppose I had won\\nand I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.\"\\nOthers say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton\\nhas moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than\\nbefore. \"Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised\\nthat,\" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. \"The relationship is\\nbased on her performance in the job.\"\\nBy all accounts, it\\'s a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good\\nworking relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an\\nalliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is\\nGates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been\\npopular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -\\nas was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.\\nIn truth, Clinton\\'s language remains harder-edged than Obama\\'s - she recently claimed that Iran\\'s\\nRevolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he\\nis to hint at using the military. \"She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,\" says Kurt\\nVolker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.\\nShe has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of\\nIsrael and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.\\nMeanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides\\nsay they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill\\nClinton gives her strategic advice. \"One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a\\nkind of baseball saying,\" she says: \"Don\\'t major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines\\nbut the trend lines.\"\\nIt is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the\\nchief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,\\nshe replies \"the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying\\nand solving problems.\" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.\\nBut maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,\\nwhen the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable\\nare the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but\\nneeds instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a\\nsmart decision - by all accounts she\\'s overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had\\ntowards her.\\n\"It\\'s fair to say that she was not born into the administration\\'s inner circle but slowly but surely, for the\\nmost consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,\" says one official. Praising what he\\ncalls her \"Terminator-quality durability and determination,\" he adds: \"She\\'s done an amazing amount of\\nwork, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.\"\\nIndeed, Clinton\\'s ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She\\nhas dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her\\nconfirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the\\nmeeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She\\nherself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her\\ncampaign claims of expertise in the field. \"It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around\\nall of these issues,\" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the\\nway she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze\\na few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, \"you may be in a different city\\nfour times a day but you have a message you\\'re trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your\\naudience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries\\' problems, six different regional or global\\nchallenges in the course of a day.\"\\nAs the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of\\ninternational issues. She is at the forefront of the US\\'s efforts to consolidate relations with a number of\\nimportant countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,\\nIndonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She\\nsays the push is working, hailing a \"change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the\\nUS\" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and\\nover Israel\\'s raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid\\nquestioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration\\'s policies.\\nDuring my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the\\ncountry\\'s increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration\\'s push to\\nsecure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her\\ncause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil\\'s foreign\\nminister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces \"an Iran that runs to\\nBrazil\" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China \"telling different things to different people to\\navoid international sanctions\". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions\\non Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. \"Of course, I don\\'t agree\\nwith everything the Secretary said,\" he says.\\nIt is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the\\nUnited Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton\\'s biographers\\ndescribed his approach to government as a \"permanent campaign\", and it appears to be his wife\\'s\\npreferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton\\'s life, it is that she never throws in\\nher cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.\\n\"Never, never!\" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the\\nfrustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. \"I have a very realistic sense of what high-\\nstakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it\\'s shocking when you are in the\\narena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,\\nbut you can\\'t take it personally.\" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She\\'s been listening to\\ncoverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders\\' wives.\\n\"Whether a woman\\'s running for office or she\\'s supporting her husband who\\'s running for office and she\\ngets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there\\'s just a lot of history that\\nyou bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,\" she says.\\nAnother country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica\\nInjustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many\\nother incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. \"I feel passionately it is in not\\njust the American national security interests but the world\\'s, that women be given the opportunities and\\nthe tools to make the most out of their own lives,\" she says.\\nIn the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she\\nsays, \"I certainly don\\'t read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do\\nmy job.\" \"It\\'s all baloney,\" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is\\nsitting to one side in her office.\\n\"Yeah, yeah, right, that\\'s what he tells me,\" Clinton responds.\\nI wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by\\ntalking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will\\nonly serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I\\nask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: \"I\\'d love that,\\nobviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.\"\\n\"Any chance it would be you?\" I ask.\\n\"No, no, I don\\'t think that\\'s in the cards,\" Clinton says. She\\'s given more categoric denials in the past. \"I\\nthink that there\\'s a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women\\nwho are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to\\nrun for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that\\'s just a fact.\" But, says one US\\nofficial, \"all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with\\nelectoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She\\'s already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: \\'What\\'s the idea\\nbehind raising her domestic profile still further?\"\\nIndeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say\\nshe could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.\\nBack in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The\\njourney goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard\\nroad. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather\\nfewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,\\nlong one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.\\nDaniel Dombey is the FT\\'s US diplomatic correspondent\\nDavid Miliband: \"Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour\"\\nIt\\'s too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is\\nlaying the foundations for long-term change in America\\'s foreign policy. The challenges are immense -\\nprobably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is\\nessential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and\\noverlapping forums - is real and right.\\nYou also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers\\nmeeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have\\nturned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.\\nThat said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her\\nhard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great\\nsense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself\\nas well as at others.\\nShe\\'s a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks\\nstrategically as well as tactically. She\\'s also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in\\na particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a\\nnecessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it\\'s\\nessential to take part.\\nThere\\'s one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the\\npeople she\\'s dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It\\'s real emotional intelligence in\\ntrying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why\\nso many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.\\nDavid Miliband is shadow foreign secretary\\nGideon Rachman: \"Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly\\nclose\"\\nA school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton\\'s stint as secretary of state would have to give\\nher 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.\\nSecretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless\\nbureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in\\npromoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry\\nKissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him\\nall the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush\\'s first secretary of state, was widely\\nadmired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which\\nlimited his ability to get things done in the wider world.\\nHillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so\\ndamaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the\\ncampaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the\\nWhite House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton\\nappointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is\\nrather detached from Obama\\'s inner circle. Obama\\'s penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign\\ncapitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than\\nanyone else to define his administration\\'s approach to the world.\\nThat still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have\\nbeen appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.\\nAsked about Clinton\\'s impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and\\nsays: \"She\\'s done some great trips, and she\\'s highly professional. But it\\'s hard to see any particular area\\nwhere she has really driven policy.\"\\nGideon Rachman is the FT\\'s chief foreign affairs columnist\\nDavid Rothkopf: \"When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly\"\\nHillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued\\nhis agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with\\nother members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.\\nThat includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise\\nof new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy\\nstructure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with\\nprivate and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.\\nWhen the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.\\nThis has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.\\nStill, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the\\nmost powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the\\nsituation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely\\ndifficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea\\'s nuclear programmes, the rise of\\nemerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.\\nWe have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to\\none where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to\\nwork in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of\\nthose things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.\\nHillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature\\nissues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.\\nDavid Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with expertise in\\nnational security; Huma Abedin<Huma@clintonemail.com>; Jake\\nRELEASE IN PART B6Are you okay w the below?\\nGo U.S.!Madame Secretary:\\nOn flight home from Kampala, which was exhausting\\nMonday, but whatever you hear, the big picture is this:\\nI am sending Info memo B5\\nTo become operational, any crimes of aggression\\n1. must still be affirmatively revoted by two thirds votes of states parties\\n2 no earlier than 2017\\n3 there will be another review conf probably before this goes into effect 4of the two ways of referring crime one goes\\nthrough an exclusive sc trigger;\\n5 the other branch has\\nA a prior sc filter *and*\\nB an ex post sc red light plus\\nC requires full vote of 9 judges of pretrial division and D nonconsenting aggressor states can opt out and E prosecutor\\nmust have reasonable basis for investigation under definition which F has now been significantly narrowed\\nI can elaborate Monday\\nBest\\nHarold\\nHarold Hongju Koh\\nThe Legal Adviser\\nU.S. Department of State\\nSuite 6421\\n2201 C St. NW\\nWashington, DC 20520-6421\\n202 647 9598 officeSullivan, Jacob J <SullivanJJ@state.gov>\\nSaturday, June 12, 2010 11:45 AM\\nRe: Pls Clear: Anniversary of Iran\\'s Disputed Presidential ElectionWord is that we\\'re going to announce our response to the Israeli flotilla investigation today.

Friends\\nand co-workers said he vacillates from day to day, sometimes minute to minute. He might\\nleave in December after the midterms; or he might stay until next summer, depending on\\nwhether Daley runs or President Barack Obama asks him to stick around, they said.\\nAnd even as he pines for his native Chicago, Emanuel continues to put down real roots in\\nD.C., recently writing the check to enroll his children in the exclusive Maret School in\\nWashington through the 2011 school year, according to a person close to Emanuel.\\nHe\\'s shown few signs of loosening his grip on the tiller — bombarding White House\\nstaffers with long-distance calls during the first days of the Gulf oil spill even as he\\ntraveled in Israel for his son\\'s bar mitzvah.\\nAnd in a broader sense, it\\'s hard to imagine Emanuel\\'s huge personality extracted from\\nthe political, journalistic and bar stool life of Obama\\'s Washington.\\nTake the last game of last week\\'s NBA Finals, when any American voter could wander\\ninto Tunnicliff\\'s Tavern on Capitol Hill and witness one of the most powerful men in the\\nnation egging on the Boston Celtics — screaming at the flat-screen TV, actually — joined\\nby a merry band that included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.);\\nJim Manley, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.); and a pair of\\nfavorite reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post.\\nDespite a British tabloid story asserting that Emanuel is sick of Obama\\'s \"idealism\" and is\\nracing for the exit, the former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman\\nstill loves the attention and power of his current job and hasn\\'t made up his mind when\\nhe\\'s leaving, people who know him said.\\n\"This is BS. And if you need it for translation, it is baseless,\" Emanuel said in a statement\\npushing back against a story in the U.K.\\'s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel as restless!\\nand fed up.\\nReplacing Emanuel, when he eventually goes, will be no easy task for Obama and the\\nsmall clique of close advisers led by Pete Rouse, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett.\\nFor one thing, Obama and company need to know what the post-November political\\nlandscape looks like before picking a successor: If Republicans take back one or more\\nhouse of Congress, the new chief of staff will need to know how to leverage executive\\npower against a hostile Hill; if Democrats retain their majorities, Emanuel\\'s successor will\\nneed some of his legislative skills.\\nBarring a major course correction, Obama, who prizes loyalty and familiarity, isn\\'t likely to\\nreach too far outside his inner circle, advisers said.\\nStill, the president is increasingly cognizant of his reputation for insularity and would quite\\nlikely give a serious look at respected former Clinton chiefs of staff Leon Panetta, currenW\\nhead of the CIA, or John Podesta, who runs the Center for American Progress, a major\\nliberal think tank with close ties to the administration.\\nRouse, a senior adviser who served as Obama\\'s Senate chief of staff, is considered the\\nbest pure manager in the White House and a logical choice to replace Emanuel, according\\nto a half-dozen.administration officials and consultants.\\nBut Rouse\\'s colleagues say the quiet 60-year-old insider loves his work, the Grateful Dead\\nand his cats — but despises the spotlight and would most likely turn down the job unless\\nObama insisted.\\n\"The key thing about Pete is that the president trusts him and would feel very, very\\ncomfortable with him in charge,\" said a Democratic consultant who knows both men well.\\n\"But he probably won\\'t take it.\"\\nOne possible candidate — deputy chief of staff Jim Messina, Emanuel\\'s political go-to guy\\n— is likely to play a major role in Obama\\'s 2012 reelection campaign and is expected to\\nmove to Chicago sometime next year.\\nIn Messina\\'s absence, another Emanuel favorite — Deputy National Security Adviser Tom\\nDonilon — has emerged as a possible successor, according to people close to the\\nsituation.\\nObama has been impressed by Donilon\\'s presentations at the President\\'s Daily Briefing,\\nand the Rhode Island native has a wide variety of political and governmental experience,\\nserving as a congressional liaison under President Jimmy Carter, chief State Department\\nspokesman under President Bill Clinton and a campaign adviser who helped Obama\\nprepare for debates against John McCain.\\nOne major Donilon drawback: He served as an executive vice president for Fannie Mae,\\nthe bailed-out mortgage giant, and reportedly lobbied against stronger regulatory\\noversight.\\nDavid Plouffe, Obama\\'s 2008 campaign manager, is another contender, with a reputation\\nfor discipline, team building and solid management skills. But Plouffe has been reluctant to\\nsettle down in Washington, is earning a stellar living as a consultant and hates the press.\\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is also a possible successor, even though\\nhis nomination for Health and Human Services secretary was scuttled by revelations he\\nfailed to report limo rides paid for by a corporate client.\\nAnother White House aide, Phil Schiliro, is a favorite of Obama\\'s for his legislative savvy\\nand political instincts. But critics said he lacks the range of policy and political experience\\nthat other candidates possess, and that his mastery of the Hill won\\'t mean much if\\nDemocrats surrender their majorities in either house.\\nThen there\\'s Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Biden\\'s brainy and politically astute chief\\nof staff, who is said to be intensely interested in making the move from the Eisenhower\\nExecutive Office Building to the West Wing.\\nKlain — who also served as Al Gore\\'s chief of staff — is well-regarded inside the White\\nHouse. Plus, he\\'s got a touch of star power: Kevin Spacey played him in the HBO movie\\n\"Recount,\" about his role in guiding the Gore campaign through the 2000 Florida recount.\\nKlain\\'s downside: He\\'s essentially an outsider who has yet to develop a serious rapport\\nwith the president, according to insiders.\\nC 2010 Capitol News Company, LLChttp://maxblumenthal.com/2010/06/the-israeli-medias-flotilla-fail/\\nThe Israeli Media\\'s Flotilla Fail\\nOn 06.22.10, By Max Blumenthal\\nMy summaty of the Israeli media\\'s shambolic performance following the flotilla massacre was originally published here in\\nHebrew at Dvorit Shargal\\'s excellent Israeli media blog, Velvet Underground. The English version follows:\\nIf the raid of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a disaster for the Israel Defense Forces, its aftermath demonstrated an\\nequally bewildering performance by the Israeli media. The IDF Spokesman\\'s Office churned out one misleading claim\\nafter another, each one more implausible than the next, seeking to implant in the public\\'s mind a version of events that\\nbore little relation to reality. To a degree, this was to be expected; but it was startling to see how some of Israel\\'s most\\nrespected reporters lined up to serve as military stenographers, barely challenging the IDF\\'s rapidly changing versions of\\nevents. IDF claims about the flotilla passengers\\' links to Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted at the Israeli Navy, and\\ntheir terrorist intentions were eagerly broadcast by the Israeli media without a second thought. When independent\\nreporters forced the IDF to retract or \"clarify\" all of these claims, Israeli news outlets refused to correct their errors, or\\ncovered them up without acknowledgment.\\nIt so happened that I arrived in Israel for a research trip the day after the flotilla raid. As a result, I was able to do\\nsomething which I always thought to be a very basic journalistic practice, so basic it\\'s supposed to be applied routinely:\\nAsking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims. What I found bewildering is that at least judging\\nfrom Israeli media reports, few, if any, mainstream reporters applied this practice, and when a visiting colleague did their\\njob for them – nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report.\\nOn June 2, the IDF disseminated a press release entitled, \"Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaeda\\nmercenaries.\" The accusation was not accompanied by any conclusive evidence — the IDF reported that Mavi Marmara\\npassengers were equipped with night-vision goggles (gasp!). This did not stop Yedioth\\'s Ron Ben-Yishai, who was\\nembedded with the Navy commandos, from amplifying the baseless charge. Citing an \"interrogation\" of Marmara\\npassengers — \"lynchers,\" he called them — Ben-Yishai wrote the same day, \"Some among the [flotilla passengers] are\\nbelieved to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda.\" The article made no reference to any efforts on part of\\nBen Yishai to investigate this claim, nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerous\\noperatives of Osama Bin Laden — presumably they would attack again, wouldn\\'t they? •\\nOn June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the Real News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesman\\'s Office\\nto demand further evidence of the Marmara\\'s Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses from spokespeople from the\\nIDF\\'s Israel and North America desks: \"We don\\'t have any evidence. The press release was based on information from\\nthe National Security Council.\" Hours later, the IDF retracted its claim, changing the title of its press release to, \"Attackers\\nof IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers.\" Despite the official retraction, Ben-Yishai\\'s article remains\\nuncorrected.\\nOn June 4, the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Naval\\nwarship. \"Go back to Aushwitz!\" a Marmara passenger shouted, according to the IDF. YNet and Haaretz reported on and\\nreproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity. Forget that the voice uttering the anti-Semitic slur sounded\\nlike a mentally disturbed teenager; had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman\\'s Office website, they\\nwould have found a longer clip released on May 31 that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara with\\nno mention of Auschwitz. Further, the voice of flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf was featured in the \"Aushwitz\" clip, yet Arraf\\nwas not aboard the Marmara (she was on the Challenger One). Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit public\\nhysteria surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism?\\nOn my blog, I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF\\'s footage and raised the question of doctoring. The next day, the\\nIDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage, releasing a \"clarification\" and a new clip claiming to consist of the\\n\"full\" exchange between the Navy and the flotilla. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify.\\nDespite the IDF\\'s admission, YNet and Haaretz have not corrected their original reports, though Haaretz has at least\\naltered its headline. Once the doctoring was exposed, the New York Times covered the episode in detail, directing\\ninternational attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel\\'s parochial press\\ncorps.\\nOn June 7, Haaretz\\'s Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotilla\\npassengers had links to international terror. The press release was larded with highly implausible claims, including that\\nKen O\\'Keefe, who runs an aid organization with Tony Blair\\'s sister-in-law, was planning to train a Hamas commando unit\\nin the Gaza Strip. When I called the IDF Spokesman\\'s Office, I learned that once again, no evidence was available to\\nsupport their press release. \"There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case,\" Sgt. Chen Arad told me.\\n\"Obviously I\\'m unable to give you more information.\" Did Pfeffer demand more evidence? If he did and was answered in\\nthe same manner as I did, why did Haaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact?\\nJoined by Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos Harel, Pfeffer became a channel for another daytime\\ndeception by the IDF. On May 31, the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Naval\\ncommandos — the flotilla passengers\\' side of the story was ignored — claiming they had faced live fire and lynching\\nattempts from Marmara passengers. Since the story was published, the IDF has produced scant evidence to support\\neither accusation. The article was accompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesman\\'s Office depicting a\\nbearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists. Daylight beamed in from a window behind\\nthe man. Haaretz\\'s caption, which was sourced to the IDF, asserted that the photo was taken \"after\" the commandos had\\nboarded the Marmara. However, the commandos raided the ship at night, while the photo was taken during the day. Once\\nagain, the IDF\\'s story was fishy.\\nI called Sgt. Arad at the IDF Spokesman\\'s Office to investigate. He told me he had no evidence to support the photo\\'s\\nquestionable caption. Soon after our phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered the caption, removing its claim that the\\nphoto was taken \"after\" the commando raid. For nearly a week, the false photo caption had remained intact. Why did\\nHaaretz suddenly change it? The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesman\\'s\\nOffice. If true, the tip-off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the country\\'s media.\\nIn the wake of the flotilla raid, Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global media\\'s investigation into the\\nbloodbath that occurred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. After all, no one had better access to the military or the\\neyewitnesses aboard the flotilla. Instead, too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscripted\\ninto the IDF\\'s hapless information war, leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters who\\nremembered to view claims by any nation\\'s military with extreme skepticism.\\nSo why do well-connected, experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly, and fail to follow up when IDF claims\\nare retracted? Is it simple bias, a desire to present their military in the best possible light, a desire so strong they abandon\\ntheir duty to their readers to verify their information? Are they afraid of sanctions, of losing contacts and access to\\ninformation? Do they fear personal reprisals? Their readers, and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as a\\nvital source of information, need to know.See below — you fine with this?\\ncdmAm passing on as requested.

Stanley McChrystal. It\\'s a Thursday night in mid-April,\\nand the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in\\nParis. He\\'s in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually\\nhave allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United\\nStates. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany\\'s president\\nand sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to\\nkeep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.\\n\"The dinner comes with the position, sir,\" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.\\nMcChrystal turns sharply in his chair.\\n\"Hey, Charlie,\" he asks, \"does this come with the position?\"\\nMcChrystal gives him the middle finger.\\nThe general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations\\ncenter. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel\\'s thick carpet,\\nhooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian\\ncasual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his\\nadvisers says, is the \"most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine.\" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any\\nplace with candles on the tables as too \"Gucci.\" He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega\\nNights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt\\ncomfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the\\nPentagon\\'s most secretive black ops.\\n\"What\\'s the update on the Kandahar bombing?\" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car\\nbombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general\\'s assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.\\n\"We have two KIAs, but that hasn\\'t been confirmed,\" Flynn says.\\nMcChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in\\nRescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you\\'ve fucked up or\\ndisappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.\\n\"I\\'d rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,\" McChrystal says.\\nHe pauses a beat.\\n\"Unfortunately,\" he adds, \"no one in this room could do it.\"\\nWith that, he\\'s out the door.\\n\"Who\\'s he going to dinner with?\" I ask one of his aides.\\n\"Some French minister,\" the aide tells me. \"It\\'s fucking gay.\"\\nThe next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French\\nmilitary academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes\\nwith a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss\\noff almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he\\ngave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as\\n\"shortsighted,\" saying it would lead to a state of \"Chaos-istan.\" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president\\nhimself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal\\nseemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile\\nNow, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get\\ntoday, and how he should respond. \"I never know what\\'s going to pop out until I\\'m up there, that\\'s the problem,\" he says.\\nThen, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-\\nliner.\\n\"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?\" McChrystal says with a laugh. \"Who\\'s that?\"\\n\"Biden?\" suggests a top adviser. \"Did you say: Bite Me?\"\\nWhen Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign\\npromise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. \"I want the\\nAmerican people to understand,\" he announced in March 2009. \"We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle\\nand defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\" He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since\\nthe war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David\\nMcKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn\\'t know and had\\nmet only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in\\nmore than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.\\nEven though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The\\ngeneral first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials\\nin a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama\\nlooked \"uncomfortable and intimidated\" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the\\nOval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn\\'t go much better. \"It was a 10-minute\\nphoto op,\" says an adviser to McChrystal. \"Obama clearly didn\\'t know anything about him, who he was. Here\\'s the guy\\nwho\\'s going to run his fucking war, but he didn\\'t seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed.\"\\nFrom the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a\\ncontroversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the\\nPentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military\\'s preference for high-tech violence with the demands of\\nfighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the\\nenemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation\\'s government — a\\nprocess that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially\\nrebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:\\nThink the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his\\n\"surge\" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.\\nNicknamed \"COINdinistas\" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution\\nfor Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.\\nAs McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists\\nin Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.\\nAfter arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary\\nRobert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn\\'t send another\\n40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of \"mission failure.\"\\nThe White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak\\non national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was\\ndetermined to kick the president\\'s ass.\\nLast fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in\\nAfghanistan. \"I found that time painful,\" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. \"I was selling an\\nunsellable position.\" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against\\nexperienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in\\nAfghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. \"The entire\\nCOIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,\" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading\\ncritic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. \"The idea that we are going to spend a trillion\\ndollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.\\nIn the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the\\npresident laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It\\'s expensive; we\\'re in an economic\\ncrisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.\\nThen, without ever using the words \"victory\" or \"win,\" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops\\nto Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,\\nbehind the counterinsurgency crowd.\\nToday, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.\\nIn June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions\\nof dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.\\ntroops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that\\nbegan in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it\\nas a \"bleeding ulcer.\" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and\\nObama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The\\npresident finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even\\nthough it\\'s precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he\\ndidn\\'t want.\\nEven those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to\\naccomplish in Afghanistan, it\\'s going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. \"It\\'s not going to look like a win, smell\\nlike a win or taste like a win,\" says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. \"This is going\\nto end in an argument.\"\\nThe night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O\\'Shea\\'s, an Irish pub catering to tourists,\\naround the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she\\nhas seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie\\'s 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has\\ninvited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the \"least Gucci\" place his staff could find. His wife isn\\'t surprised.\\n\"He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,\" she says with a laugh.\\nThe general\\'s staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.\\nThere\\'s a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two\\nfighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as\\nTeam America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves\\non their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about\\nchanging the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had\\ntaken to deriding ISAF as short for \"I Suck at Fighting\" or \"In Sandals and Flip-Flops.\") McChrystal banned alcohol on\\nbase, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands\\nof officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub\\nmodeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg\\'s offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary\\nfor sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend\\naround the general, I witness him eating only once.) It\\'s a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a\\nstaple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man\\nsingle-handedly winning the war.\\nBy midnight at Kitty O\\'Shea\\'s, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps\\nfrom a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal\\'s top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own\\ninvention.\"Afghanistan!\" they bellow.\"Afghanistan!\" They call it their Afghanistan song.\\nMcChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. \"All these men,\" he tells me. \"I\\'d die for them. And they\\'d die\\nfor me.\"\\nThe assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group\\nrepresents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable\\ncommand of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an\\nassortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special\\nRepresentative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary\\nClinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into\\nthe mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal\\'s team to call\\nthe shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. \"It jeopardizes the mission,\"\\nsays Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. \"The military cannot\\nby itself create governance reform.\"\\nPart of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State\\nDepartment receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit\\nabout many of Obama\\'s top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and\\nveteran of the Cold War, a \"clown\" who remains \"stuck in 1985.\" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,\\n\"turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk\\nshows. Frankly, it\\'s not very helpful.\" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal\\'s inner circle. \"Hillary\\nhad Stan\\'s back during the strategic review,\" says an adviser. \"She said, \\'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.\\'\"\\nMcChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. \"The Boss says\\nhe\\'s like a wounded animal,\" says a member of the general\\'s team. \"Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he\\'s going to\\nget fired, so that makes him dangerous. He\\'s a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp\\nonto. But this is COIN, and you can\\'t just have someone yanking on shit.\"\\nAt one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. \"Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,\" he groans. \"I\\ndon\\'t even want to open it.\" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in\\nhis pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.\\n\"Make sure you don\\'t get any of that on your leg,\" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.\\nBy far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.\\nAccording to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and\\n2005 — can\\'t stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He\\'s also furious that McChrystal, backed by\\nNATO\\'s allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the\\ndiplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively\\nincreased McChrystal\\'s influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. \"In reality, that position needs to be filled\\nby an American for it to have weight,\" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.\\nThe relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New\\nYork Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal\\'s\\nstrategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as \"not an adequate strategic partner,\" and cast doubt on whether the\\ncounterinsurgency plan would be \"sufficient\" to deal with Al Qaeda. \"We will become more deeply engaged here with no\\nway to extricate ourselves,\" Eikenberry warned, \"short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and\\nchaos.\"\\nMcChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. \"I like Karl, I\\'ve known him for years, but they\\'d never said\\nanything like that to us before,\" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt \"betrayed\" by the leak. \"Here\\'s one that covers his\\nflank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, \\'I told you so.\\'\"\\nThe most striking example of McChrystal\\'s usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not\\ndiplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead\\nAfghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered\\ncredible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied\\nthe president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.\\nIn February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president\\'s palace to get\\nhim to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai\\'s staff, however, insisted that the\\npresident was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted\\nthe aid of Afghanistan\\'s defense minister, who persuaded Karzai\\'s people to wake the president from his nap.\\nThis is one of the central flaws with McChrystal\\'s counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government\\nputs us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we\\'ve backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his\\ncable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. \"He\\'s been locked up in his\\npalace the past year,\" laments one of the general\\'s top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined\\nMcChrystal\\'s desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.\\nsoldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. \"General,\" he called out to McChrystal, \"I didn\\'t even know we were\\nfighting in Uruzgan!\"\\nGrowing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him\\nthroughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all\\njoined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he\\nmade no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a\\nfastball down the middle.\\nMcChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the\\nlast to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The \"Prison on the Hudson,\" as it was known then, was a\\npotent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,\\nand birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called \"rat fucking,\" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or\\nmud, covered in shaving cream. \"It was pretty out of control,\" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to\\nserve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls \"huge talent\" and\\n\"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,\" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.\\nforces in Iraq.\\nThe son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to\\nthrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more\\nthan 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a\\n\"century man.\" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after\\ndowning a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours\\nsubjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. \"I\\'d come visit, and I\\'d\\nend up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,\" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal\\nin 1973.\\nMcChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as\\nbrilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary\\nmagazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his\\ncareer. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-\\nold soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In \"Brinkman\\'s Note,\" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator\\nappears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the\\nassassin, and he\\'s able to infiltrate the White House: \"The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the\\nraincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman\\'s failure, I had succeeded.\"\\nAfter graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. \"We really\\nfelt we were a peacetime generation,\" he recalls. \"There was the Gulf War, but even that didn\\'t feel like that big of a deal.\"\\nSo McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental\\ncommander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen\\nRangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who\\nwant to climb the ranks to general don\\'t go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers\\noutdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,\\nrequired every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance\\nwith weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.\\nIn the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard\\'s Kennedy School of\\nGovernment and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks\\nof humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as\\na troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting\\ntossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that\\nfollowed September 11th. \"He was very focused,\" says Annie. \"Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he\\nwanted to do. I don\\'t think his personality has changed in all these years.\"\\nBy some accounts, McChrystal\\'s career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman\\nduring the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander\\nwith a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous \"stuff happens\"\\nremark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president\\'s Mission\\nAccomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —\\noverseeing the military\\'s most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part\\nin a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.\\nAfter Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April\\n2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He\\nsigned off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.\\n(McChrystal would later claim he didn\\'t read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander\\nknown for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,\\nspecifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman\\'s death. \"If the circumstances of\\nCorporal Tillman\\'s death become public,\" he wrote, it could cause \"public embarrassment\" for the president.\\n\"The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat\\'s true actions,\" wrote Tillman\\'s mother,\\nMary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the \"golden\\nboy\" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping\\nthe chain of command. Nine days after Tillman\\'s death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.\\nTwo years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in\\nIraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of\\nabuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even\\nthough an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so\\nunsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in\\nAfghanistan, viewing them as a \"political swamp,\" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for\\nhis confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the\\nscandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in\\nAfghanistan.\\nThe media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a\\ndweeb, a teacher\\'s pet with a Ranger\\'s tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a \"Jedi\" commander, as Newsweek called\\nhim. He didn\\'t care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor\\nrare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on\\nhis iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name\\nand four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (\"There are no limits. There are only plateaus,\\nand you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.\") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,\\nunprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. \"The fucking\\nlads love Stan McChrystal,\" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. \"You\\'d be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone\\nwould take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like \\'Who the fuck is that?\\' And it\\'s fucking Stan McChrystal.\"\\nIt doesn\\'t hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite\\nforces that carry out the government\\'s darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of\\ninsurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. \"JSOC was a killing machine,\" says Maj. Gen.\\nMayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist\\nnetworks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned\\nby the military. \"The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,\\nsitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,\" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal\\nin Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. \"He\\'d say, \\'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn\\'t find lunch without help.\\nYou got to work together with these guys.\\'\"\\nEven in his new role as America\\'s leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts\\nof a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from\\nfour to 19. \"You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,\" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the\\nhallway at headquarters. Then he\\'ll add, \"I\\'m going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though.\" In fact, the general\\nfrequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this\\nyear, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created\\ntremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special\\nForces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests\\nerupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. \"We\\'ve shot an amazing number of\\npeople,\" McChrystal recently conceded.\\nDespite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that\\nthe U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It\\'s \"insurgent math,\" as he calls it — for every innocent person you\\nkill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air\\npower and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates\\ncommanders responsible for civilian deaths. \"For a while,\" says one U.S. official, \"the most dangerous place to be in\\nAfghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a \\'civ cas\\' incident.\" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make\\nnot killing into something you can win an award for: There\\'s talk of creating a new medal for \"courageous restraint,\" a\\nbuzzword that\\'s unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.\\nBut however strategic they may be, McChrystal\\'s new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own\\ntroops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. \"Bottom line?\" says a former Special\\nForces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of\\nengagement put soldiers\\' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.\"\\nIn March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront\\nsuch accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had\\nreceived an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.\\n\"I am writing because it was said you don\\'t care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,\" Arroyo\\nwrote.\\nWithin hours, McChrystal responded personally: \"I\\'m saddened by the accusation that I don\\'t care about soldiers, as it is\\nsomething I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend\\nupon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier\\'s view is his own.\" Then he showed up at Arroyo\\'s\\noutpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live\\noperation in a dangerous war zone.\\nSix weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-\\nold corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED\\na day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general\\nwould attend Ingram\\'s memorial service. \"He started to look up to you,\" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to\\nmake it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.\\nThe night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo\\'s platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM\\nto speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard\\ntowers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen\\nsome of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram\\'s death. His commanders had\\nrepeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a\\ncombat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal\\'s new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been\\ndenied. \"These were abandoned houses,\" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. \"Nobody was coming back to live in them.\"\\nOne soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. \"Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably\\ncertain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,\" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has\\ntraveled halfway around the world to fight, that\\'s like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won\\'t\\nhave to make arrests. \"Does that make any fucking sense?\" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. \"We should just drop a fucking\\nbomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?\"\\nThe rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they\\'ve been distorted as they passed through the chain of\\ncommand — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. \"Fuck, when I came over here and\\nheard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,\" says Hicks, who has served three tours\\nof combat. \"I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his\\nbird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they\\'re all fucked up — either because\\nsomebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don\\'t understand it themselves. But we\\'re fucking losing this\\nthing.\"\\nMcChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two\\ndozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. \"I ask you what\\'s going on in your world, and I think it\\'s important for you all to\\nunderstand the big picture as well,\" McChrystal begins. \"How\\'s the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for\\nyourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you\\'re losing?\" McChrystal says.\\n\"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we\\'re losing, sir,\" says Hicks.\\nMcChrystal nods. \"Strength is leading when you just don\\'t want to lead,\" he tells the men. \"You\\'re leading by example.\\nThat\\'s what we do. Particularly when it\\'s really, really hard, and it hurts inside.\" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about\\ncounterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,\\nbut he\\'s careful not to bullshit the men. \"We are knee-deep in the decisive year,\" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no\\nlonger has the initiative — \"but I don\\'t think we do, either.\" It\\'s similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it\\'s not winning any\\nhearts and minds among the soldiers. \"This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,\" McChrystal tries to joke.\\n\"But it doesn\\'t get the same reception from infantry companies.\"\\nDuring the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use\\nlethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they\\ndid in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. \\'We aren\\'t putting fear into the Taliban,\" one soldier says.\\n\"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,\" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can\\'t\\nkill your way out of Afghanistan. \"The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn\\'t work.\"\\n\"I\\'m not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,\" the soldier persists. \"You say we\\'ve stopped the momentum of the\\ninsurgency. I don\\'t believe that\\'s true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it\\'s\\ngetting.\"\\n\"I agree with you,\" McChrystal says. \"In this area, we\\'ve not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,\\nyou have to use fire. What I\\'m telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out\\nhere and resettle it?\"\\nA soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn\\'t have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a\\ncivilian. \"That\\'s the way this game is,\" McChrystal says. \"It\\'s complex. I can\\'t just decide: It\\'s shirts and skins, and we\\'ll kill\\nall the shirts.\"\\nAs the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn\\'t succeeded at easing the men\\'s anger. He makes one\\nlast-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. \"There\\'s no way I can make that easier,\" he tells\\nthem. \"No way I can pretend it won\\'t hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you\\'re doing a great job.\\nDon\\'t let the frustration get to you.\" The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold\\nPresident Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren\\'t buying it.\\nWhen it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal\\'s side. The only foreign invader to have any success here\\nwas Genghis Khan — and he wasn\\'t hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.\\nThe COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent\\nmemory: France\\'s nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).\\nMcChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,\\nexpensive and easy to lose. \"Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,\" he says. But even if he somehow manages to\\nsucceed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to\\nshut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,\\nroads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying\\nArkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. \"It\\'s all very cynical, politically,\" says Marc Sageman, a former CIA\\ncase officer who has extensive experience in the region. \"Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there\\'s nothing for us\\nthere.\"\\nIn mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by\\nHamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in\\nKabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the\\npraises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian\\ncasualties. They mention the word \"progress\" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •\\nsession represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal\\'s strategy in months. \"There is no\\ndenying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic\\ndevelopment,\" the president says. \"As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been\\nvisible just a few years earlier.\"\\nIt is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no\\nreal progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. \"It was one of our first\\nimpressions,\" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. \"So many\\nlights shining brightly.\" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of\\nprogress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have\\nmocked. \"They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even\\ndefined or recognizable,\" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political\\nadviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. \"That\\'s the game we\\'re in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is\\nto create the perception that we didn\\'t get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become\\ngreat in the near future.\"\\nBut facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those\\nclosest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn\\'t begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things\\nare in Afghanistan. \"If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,\"\\na senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn\\'t prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from\\ndreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its\\ncounterinsurgency campaign even further. \"There\\'s a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next\\nsummer if we see success here,\" a senior military official in Kabul tells me.\\nBack in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of \"progress,\"\\nMcChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning\\nto launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country\\'s second-largest city and the Taliban\\'s original\\nhome base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that\\nMcChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more\\ngroundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like\\nFallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a \"rising tide of security.\" The Afghan police and\\narmy will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city\\nto win over the civilian population.\\nEven proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. \"This isn\\'t a classic operation,\" says a\\nU.S. military official. \"It\\'s not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren\\'t going to be doors kicked in.\" Other U.S. officials\\ninsist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it\\'s going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.\\n\"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,\" says a military official. \"We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way\\nthat doesn\\'t alienate the population.\" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders\\nsay he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.\\n\"This looks like CT-plus!\" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.\\nWhatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years\\nof war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that\\nCOIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his\\ninfluence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things\\nworse. \"Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,\" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who\\nhas studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. \"A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government\\nand creates an environment where we\\'re picking winners and losers\" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility\\namong the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the\\nprimary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using\\nthe word \"victory\" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with\\nStanley McChrystal in charge.\\nThis article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.W I\\'ll send you details later\\nSent from my iPad\\nOn 15 Jun 2010, at 02:37, \"H\" <HDR22@clintonemail.com> wrote:\\n> I would be happy to meet w hiim.

Singapore is a society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore\\'s\\ncharacteristic hard-headedness with a depth of historical understanding and context, as well as a lively human sympathy\\nfor the diversity of the region that surrounds him, which I, at any event, find almost unique. I remember interviewing\\nhim at the height of the East Asian economic crisis in 1997 and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of Asia as\\nthe growing centre of the global economy, as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were then\\nsuggesting. \"No it doesn\\'t,\" Yeo told me. \"At the most it might put back the forecasts by five or 10 years.\" It moved the\\ngraph a little to the right, it didn\\'t change the trends. On that, Yeo was absolutely right.\\nBut it is also Yeo\\'s ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable.\\nThis week, Yeo spent a few days in Australia and I caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historical\\ntour de force conversations in which he specialises.\\nIt is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudd\\'s proposal to establish an Asia-Pacific\\nCommunity. The Prime Minister wanted the US, India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal with\\nstrategic issues as well as trade and economics. Singapore\\'s hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thought\\nthat the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which it is a key member, could be sidelined. I asked Yeo whether the\\nregion was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to accomplish. \"We still need a lot more discussion,\" he said.\\n\"The vision is going to change dramatically, with the emergence of China and India on the global stage. The\\nconfiguration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred. But that\\'s the reality we\\'ve got to work\\nwith.\\nWe need a regional architecture which is able to accommodate the stresses. The single most important relationship is\\nbetween the US and China. Increasingly, the relationship between India and China is becoming more important. I think\\neventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century - the triangle\\nconsisting of the US, China and India.\"\\nYeo saw Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith in Canberra and now describes Canberra and Singapore as being in\\nharmony on the evolution of regional organisations. This is how he saw it having played out: \"When Prime Minister Rudd\\nproposed the APC, Dick Woolcott (Rudd\\'s envoy) went round the region. He did not visit all countries. He made it quite\\nplain to some that only the big countries of ASEAN need to be involved. We talked among ourselves and quite soon the\\nconclusion was reached that ASEAN was going to be sidelined. So there was an immediate blowback from the region.\\n\"To PM Rudd\\'s credit he quickly clarified this, that ASEAN is central to his conception of the APC and that that was his\\nvision from the very beginning. I said, \\'All of us in the region are very relieved to hear that\\'.\\n\"Separately we had (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating his view of an East Asian region\\napparently centred on China, Japan and Korea. It created, as you would expect, a natural reaction in Southeast Asia. That\\ngot us all thinking in the region. How to keep Russia and the US in the region in a way that\\'s comfortable. For a long time\\nwe\\'ve been thinking about China, more recently about India.\" Yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations also\\nevolved slowly, in particular the East Asia Summit, which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN, China,\\nJapan, South Korea and India. He said: \"It took us a long time to create the EAS structure. Some preferred it to be based\\non the ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, Korea), harking back to (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir\\n(Mohamad)\\'s East Asian caucus. \"Others felt that\\'s too limiting. If it\\'s just ASEAN plus three, that may be a little lop-sided\\nbecause of the economic weight of the plus three. So we thought if we have India on one side, and Australia and New\\nZealand to the south, there\\'s a certain natural equipoise.\\n\"Then it took many discussions. The Russians wanted to join the EAS but we felt this should not be rushed. Russia is too\\nimportant a country. There was some unhappiness from the Russians that we did not accommodate them in the EAS at\\nthat time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS might\\nexclude the US from the region. We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing because\\nAustralia and New Zealand were in it. In any case, countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive.\\nWhat would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs.\"\\nSo where do we end up today? \"When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN. So\\nnow there are two possibilities, either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight (including\\nthe US and Russia) configuration. In fact I had a very interesting discussion with Prime Minister Rudd. I think in the end\\nhe\\'s happy to let ASEAN members decide and he doesn\\'t want to interfere in our regional discussion.\"\\nSo you can describe what Yeo outlines as either a win or a loss for Rudd. Whatever evolves, nobody is going to call it the\\nAsia-Pacific Community and no one is going to imagine that Rudd was its founder, as everyone accepts that Bob Hawke\\nfounded APEC in 1989. On the other hand, it does seem as though it\\'s very much more than likely that there will finally\\nbe a regional organisation embracing everyone from the US to India, which is able to discuss security. That is pretty\\nmuch Rudd\\'s policy aim and, as Yeo constructively puts it, Rudd has influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends of Rudd can\\ndescribe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative. His enemies can say the APC came to nothing\\nand was a failure in Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts it in a constructive light. There is only space to give the\\nsmallest sampling of Yeo\\'s prodigiously rich insights on other issues.\\nOn the US, he said: \"Both Australia and Singapore feel it in our bones that the US will remain a great power for many\\ndecades. It is a vast country always throwing up new ideas, always on the boil. It has a sunny disposition. We in\\nSingapore and Australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties.\"\\nOn China, I asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power, financial and military, so\\nit could manage that new power in a way that was beneficial to everybody. Yeo stressed that he was sure Beijing\\'s\\npreoccupations were internal, and said: \"China is the No 1 trading partner for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India\\nand already No 2 for New Zealand, and for all the countries (in Asia) the graph points in the same direction.\"\\n(The historical process) is high drama in China. It was historically because of the large rural peasantry that Maoism\\ndeveloped as a different ideology from Bolshevism. China was 20 per cent urban. It\\'s now 40 per cent urban and will go\\nto 80 per cent or 90 per cent. The urbanisation of Europe was languid by comparison, but look at Dickens or Victor Hugo.\\nLook at the huge reaction in Europe to urbanisation and industrialisation. In China it\\'s all compressed. If they succeed\\nthey will be the greatest nation on Earth. The Chinese know they have to learn new tricks. The skills which brought them\\nto power won\\'t keep them in power.\"\\nHe recalled that early in China\\'s economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how Singapore, as a mostly\\nChinese nation, ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner, combining rapid economic growth with social\\norder and a respect for tradition. Then that interest seemed to wane. But now Chinese delegations are back again in\\nlarge numbers, fascinated particularly with how Singapore manages the politics of being a big and booming\\ncity. Mainland Chinese are even sitting in on politicians\\' electoral clinics in Singapore, observing how real problems are\\nrecognised, integrated into the system and dealt with.\\nI asked Yeo too whether he thought Japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in Asia these past 60 years. He\\nreplied: \"Their politics now are a mess. Partly because they fit the pieces together so closely, reconfiguring the pieces is-\\ndifficult. A lot of Japanese politics now is not about fitting the pieces together but pulling them apart.\\n\"The DP1 came to power determined to pull the pieces apart, the Liberal Democratic Party from big business from the\\nbureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes a long time for them to change but when they do change they do it with a\\nfury and intensity that surprises everyone.\" Japan has gone through profound periods of change in the past - the Meiji\\nRestoration of the 19th century, in which it decided to become a modern nation; or the pervasive change after World\\nWar II, in which it decided to embrace democracy and the role of the key US ally in the region. The fact that it is now\\ngrappling with change is no reason to think it cannot emerge again with a successful model.\\nYeo is an old, old friend of Australia, and in a sense a long-term champion of Australia\\'s involvement in Southeast Asia.\\nHe has been a minister in the Singapore government for more than 20 years. He embodies a great deal of institutional\\nmemory and strategic continuity, not just within Singapore but within the broader councils of the region.\\nIt\\'s just a pity he doesn\\'t visit us a bit more often.FyiAttached is the PPD.We had brief conversation about it with paul a while ago but we didn\\'t know how early conf would start.Just sent oscar call sheets for nita lowey and greek fm papandraeou for you.\\nI think jake may have told you the aide to the Greek Minister of Citizens Protection was killed in the protests earlier this\\nweek.

He is also a\\nprincipal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary\\nFund, is the co-author of \"13 Bankers.\"The Greek \"rescue\" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented\\nand far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by\\nthe International Monetary Fund, are finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have\\nabandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new\\nprogram calls for \"fiscal adjustments\" — cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts — totaling 11 percent of\\ngross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio\\npeaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest\\nenough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,\\nhas argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by\\n2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. — the initial shock to demand could\\nbe well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that\\nGreece is likely to experience a very sharp recession — and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the\\neconomy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by\\nanother 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely\\noptimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward\\nGreece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece\\nneeds to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece\\'s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end\\nof 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece\\'s economy — e.g., with\\nG.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5\\npercent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-\\nG.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit\\nof around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an\\n\"upside scenario.\"The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,\\nroughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign\\ndebt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay\\nthe Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their \"new normal.\"\\nLast week the European leadership panicked — very late in the day — when it realized that the euro zone itself was at\\nrisk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors\\nwill run from Portugal and Spain also — if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published\\nrecently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank\\nruns in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a \"run,\" it is not clear where it\\nstops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.\\nEven the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans\\ndecided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small\\nchance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward — and\\nenormous collateral damage — in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a\\ndebt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise;\\nleading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek\\n\"restructuring,\" because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain,\\nIreland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greeks\\npay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? It\\nall becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended and\\nat what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making under\\npressurein the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so its\\ngovernment bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely\\nnot hold together.There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that would\\nproduce:-\\nTalk down the euro — moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one.-\\nAs the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-term\\nfinancing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt..\\nOnce the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e.,\\nprevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent\\nby buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.•\\nAt that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That will\\ninclude Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through.•\\nEuropean banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massive\\nfailure of euro groupthink — including most notably at the political level — but there is no question that bank executives\\nhave not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse.To the extent possible, some of the\\nensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for a\\nreason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies. Dismantle with care.Another possible scenario: With Anji Hunter now, Tony\\'s friend, talked to Peter yesterday, who had no clue, he will make\\nstatement tomorrow, no guidance, but Anjils sense is but wholly conjectural that Gordon will be pushed aside, let Tories\\nform minoroty government, fight for David for leader and go into opposition, that is one Blairite view.

Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in\\nthe war face an uncertain and tricky future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an\\nimpatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.\\nRichard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration\\'s special representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the\\nambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal\\'s career-\\nending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.\\nBut privately, at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal\\'s exit as an excuse for a\\nhousecleaning, according to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies\\nheavily on civilian support, these people said.\\nIn recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might be\\nreplaced by\\nRyan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeus\\nduring the successful Iraq troop increase.\\nSuch a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr. Crocker\\'s prestigious new post at\\nTexas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront Ambassador\\nEikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should work\\ntogether in war.\\nIt also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him\\nup as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between President\\nHamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.\\nPrior to General Petraeus\\'s arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several\\nforceful, ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials\\nacknowledge that, as one said, \"There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team.\" But the White\\nHouse believes that the current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent.\\nStill, the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State\\nHillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team,\\ntwo officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.\\n\"You can\\'t have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at\\neverything,\" said a senior State Department official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.\\nBe\\nGeneral Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation\\nhearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke\\nand would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.\\n\"Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,\" General Petraeus said in an interview. \"We have had, and do\\nhave, a very good relationship.\" That role, he said, will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry.\\nAmbassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon\\'s proposal last year to send 60,000 additional troops to\\nAfghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General Petraeus was the true\\narchitect of the plan.\\nThe ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan, graduated from\\nWest Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at the academy. The two share\\na scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador Eikenberry has Master\\'s degrees\\nfrom\\nHarvard and Stanford.\\nWhile they were never assigned together, their careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment\\nof Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General\\nEikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.\\nGeneral Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues, while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down\\nrequests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not\\nreturn a call for comment.\\nFor Mr. Holbrooke, the new landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it\\nwas six months ago, when his ouster was the subject of endless Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less\\ncentral player:\\nJacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped\\nshape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke\\'s current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his\\nown allies admit. He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping\\nAfghanistan build an economy.\\nThese days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking\\nto draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries in\\nMadrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government\\'s campaign to reintegrate\\nTaliban fighters into mainstream society.\\nMr. Karzai\\'s longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders, and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr.\\nHolbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke\\'s\\nnegotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of American interests. For now, though, as evidence of\\nGeneral Petraeus\\'s influence, he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad.\\nOn his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army\\nchief of staff,\\nAshfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke\\'s past run-ins with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to\\ndeal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials said they trusted him.\\nHusain Haqqani, Pakistan\\'s ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to understand Pakistan\\'s\\nconcerns. \"Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even by those who may\\nnot like him,\" Mr. Haqqani said.\\nStill, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure\\nvideoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said, General Petraeus threw his support behind a\\ncostly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban\\nstronghold that is the next major American military target.\\nMr. Holbrooke and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.Maariv: Netanyahu won\\'t meet Clinton; \\'sources\\' say she\\n\"isn\\'t relevant\"\\nDidi Remez I July 1,2010 at 15:25 I Categories: Diplomacy I URL: http://wp.me/pH1QV-Ep\\nDo they honestly think that publicizing a quote like this, on record or off, works to their advantage?\\nIsraeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister\\'s Office -- DR] sources said: \"Clinton isn\\'t relevant and\\nis out of the circle of influence.

For now, the Israeli government intends to uproot as many villages as possible and erase them\\nfrom the map by establishing \"facts on the ground\" in the form of JNF forests. (See video of of al-Arakib\\'s\\ndemolition here).\\nMoments before the destruction of the Bedouin village of al-Arakib, Israeli high school age police volunteers lounge on\\nfurniture taken from a family\\'s home. [The following four photos are by Ata Abu Madyam of Arab Negev News.\\nOne of the most troubling aspects of the destruction of al-Arakib was a report by CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riot\\npolice who stormed the village were accompanied by \"busloads of cheering civilians.\" Who were these civilians and why\\ndidn\\'t CNN or any outlet investigate further?\\nI traveled to al-Arakib yesterday with a delegation from Ta\\'ayush, an Israeli group that promotes a joint Arab-Jewish\\nstruggle against the occupation. The activists spent the day preparing games and activities for the village\\'s traumatized\\nchildren, helping the villagers replace their uprooted olive groves, and assisting in the reconstruction of their demolished\\nhomes. In a massive makeshift tent where many of al-Arakib\\'s residents now sleep, I interviewed village leaders about the\\nidentity of the cheering civilians. Each one confirmed the presence of the civilians, describing how they celebrated the\\ndemolitions. As I compiled details, the story grew increasingly horrific. After interviewing more than a half dozen \\'elders of\\nthe village, I was able to finally identify the civilians in question. What I discovered was more disturbing than I had\\nima. med.\\nIsraeli police youth volunteers pick through the belongings an al-Arakib family\\nArab Negev News publisher Ata Abu Madyam supplied me with a series of photos he took of the civilians in action. They\\ndepicted Israeli high school students who appeared to have volunteered as members of the Israeli police civilian guard (I\\n\\'am working on identifying some participants by name). Prior to the demolitions, the student volunteers were sent into the\\nvillagers\\' homes to extract their furniture and belongings. A number of villagers including Madyam told me the volunteers\\nsmashed windows and mirrors in their homes and defaced family photographs with crude drawings. Then they lounged\\naround on the furniture of al-Arakib residents in plain site of the owners. Finally, according to Matyam, the volunteers\\ncelebrated while bulldozers destroyed the homes.\\n\"What we learned from the summer camp of destruction,\" Madyam remarked, \"is that Israeli youth are not being educated\\non democracy, they are being raised on racism.\" (The cover of the latest issue of Madyam\\'s Arab Negev News features a\\nphoto of Palestinians being expelled to Jordan in 1948 juxtaposed with a photo of a family fleeing al-Arakib last week. The\\nheadline reads, \"Nakba 2010.\")\\n0\\nAccording to residents of al-Arakib, the youth volunteers vandalized homes throughout the village\\nThe Israeli civilian guard, which incorporates 70,000 citizens including youth as young as 15 (about 15% of Israeli police\\nvolunteers are teenagers), is one of many programs designed to incorporate Israeli children into the state\\'s military\\napparatus. It is not hard to imagine what lessons the high school students who participated in the leveling of al-Arakib took\\nfrom their experience, nor is it especially difficult to predict what sort of citizens they will become once they reach\\'\\nadulthood. Not only are they being indoctrinated to swear blind allegiance to the military, they are learning to treat the\\nArab outclass as less than human. The volunteers\\' behavior toward Bedouins, who are citizens of Israel and serve loyally\\nin Israeli army combat units despite widespread racism, was strikingly reminiscent of the behavior of settler youth in\\nHebron who pelt Palestinian shopkeepers in the old city with eggs, rocks and human waste. If there is a distinction\\nbetween the two cases, it is that the Hebron settlers act as vigilantes while the teenagers of Israeli civilian guard vandalize\\nArab property as agents of the state.\\nThe spectacle of Israeli youth helping destroy al-Arakib helps explain why 56% of Jewish Israeli high school students do\\nnot believe Arabs should be allowed to serve in the Knesset — why the next generation wants apartheid. Indeed, the\\nwidespread indoctrination of Israeli youth by the military apparatus is a central factor in Israel\\'s authoritarian trend. It\\nwould be difficult for any adolescent boy to escape from an experience like al-Arakib, where adults in heroic warror garb\\nencoura e him to articipate in and gloat over acts of massive destruction, with even a trace of democratic values.\\nYouth volunteers extract belongings from village homes as bulldozers move in\\nAs for the present condition of Israeli democracy, it is essential to consider the way in which the state pits its own citizens\\nagainst one another, enlisting the Jewish majority as conquerers while targeting the Arab others as, in the wordsI of Zionist\\nfounding father Chaim Weizmann, \"obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path.\" Historically, only failing states\\nhave encouraged such corrosive dynamics to take hold. That is why the scenes from al-Arakib, from the demolished\\nhomes to the uprooted gardens to the grinning teens who joined the mayhem, can be viewed as much more than the\\ndestruction of a village. They are snapshots of the phenomenon that is laying Israeli society as a whole to waste\\n0\\n...and the destruction beginssbwhoeop\\nMonday, August 2, 2010 12:37 PM\\nfyi\\nGo Back\\nPrint this page\\nSkip to content\\nSubscribe to The New Yorker\\nC3\\nThe Political Scene\\nThe Empty Chamber\\nJust how broken is the Senate?\\nSeventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,\\nhaven\\'t come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the\\nObama Administration....\\nThe tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction.

It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and\\ntop, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.\\n\"Also, it\\'s a dumb rule in itself,\" McCaskill said. \"It\\'s time we started looking at some of these rules.\"\\nShe was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and\\nsubcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had\\nscheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn\\'t be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general\\nand an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin\\'s Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill\\'s\\nSubcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghan\\npolice. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victory\\nceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-care\\nreform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law\\'s most embarrassing\\nsweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who had fought the\\nbill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.\\nSo, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard\\nBurr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin\\'s committee, had refused. \"I have no personal objection to\\ncontinuing,\" Burr said. But, he added, \"there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object.\"\\nBurr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In\\ngeneral, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren\\'t around, and the two or three who might be\\npresent aren\\'t listening. They\\'re joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their first\\nlook at a speech they\\'re about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The\\npresiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them to\\nthe ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about the\\nSenate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, \"Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the\\nfloor. You know what you\\'ll see happening? Nothing. When I\\'m in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they\\'re\\ndoing in China right now?\"\\nBetween speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name every\\nfew minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the press\\nlounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interest\\nactually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On this\\nafternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcription\\nmachines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is an\\nintimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.\\nLike many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to\\nhover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some\\nbuilt as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority\\nand Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,\\n\"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what\\'s happening on the floor during debate and not\\nbe distracted by committee work. Clearly, it\\'s an old rule.\"\\nThe Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; the\\ngeneral and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators these\\ndays direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-term\\nsuccesses while magnifying their institution\\'s broader dysfunction.\\nAround five o\\'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three\\namendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an\\namendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch the\\namendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was to\\nfinish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn\\'t miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only\\nthing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty\\nminutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word\\'s being spoken, were about to\\nyield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,\\nwould go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.\\nMax Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, \"This is the first time in recent memory\\nthat a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the\\nreconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated.\"\\nTall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill\\'s Republican manager, took the floor. \"The position on the other side\\nof the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good,\" he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose\\nhalf an octave. \"Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an\\ninconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an\\ninconvenience.\"\\nThe Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded\\nDemocratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to\\nemphasize the senators\\' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides the\\nchamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third\\nperson, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the\\nmoment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson\\'s \"Manual of\\nParliamentary Practice\"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insulting\\nany senator\\'s state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at Al\\nFranken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer\\'s chair: \"Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent\\nof every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator on\\nthe other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President\\'s Waterloo. They want to kill health-care\\nreform!\"\\nThe voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: \"The time of the senator has expired.\"\\nFor the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens\\non the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats\\nwhile appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn\\'t\\nhave to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to\\nmake Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One\\namendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less\\nthan two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a\\nLouisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican\\nobstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not be\\ndenied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent \"convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders\" from\\nbuying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra\\namendment without cracking a smile. \"This is not a game amendment,\" he insisted. \"It actually saves money.\"\\nSo many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.\\n\"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate,\" Baucus declared. \"It is a crass\\npolitical stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy.\" Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a\\nclerk called the roll at a ragged pace. \"Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins.\" Thirty-five-second pause. \"Mr. Conrad, Mr.\\nCorker.\" Ten seconds. \"Mr. Cornyn.\" Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they\\'re\\nso inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber\\'s gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues\\nmilling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain—\\nnow just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catch\\nthe eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, of\\nNebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.\\nThe carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled drone\\nwas that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, \"Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!\" Sporadically, a\\nsharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could charm into\\nlaughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin a\\nshambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set of\\nbehaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on a\\ncolleague\\'s shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (Russ\\nFeingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (Dick\\nDurbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).\\nPast midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through\\nher mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. \"Can we\\nget some order?\" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It\\nwas the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.\\nHarry Reid controls the Senate\\'s schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.\\nSince nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous\\nnegotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,\\nunsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was\\nhunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamber\\nto confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan,\\nher hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily\\neased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting\\nher Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, \"The longest it lasted was thirty seconds.\"\\nAt two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just found\\ntwo small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats\\' efforts, the bill would\\ngo back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitol\\'s\\nnortheast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets.\\nOn a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting for\\nsomeone to take him away.\\nThe Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the\\nDemocrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. \"Everyone\\'s\\ntired,\" Reid declared before the final vote. \"This legislative fight is one for the record books.\" He was so fatigued that he\\ninitially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. \"Way to go, Lindsey, way to\\nstretch it out,\" Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losing\\nteam at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment the\\nchamber\\'s Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.\\nThe Senate is often referred to as \"the world\\'s greatest deliberative body.\" Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from\\nOregon, said, \"That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of\\nexchange of ideas, is so limited.\" Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a\\nRepublican and a Democrat. \"The memory I took with me was: \\'Wow, that\\'s unusual—there\\'s a conversation occurring in\\nwhich they\\'re making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.\\' And yet nobody else was in the chamber.\"\\nTom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator\\'s mind.\\n\"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue,\" he said.\\nInstead, a senator typically gives \"a prepared speech that\\'s already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets\\nup and gives a speech on a completely different subject.\" From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a\\ncolloquy—\"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa\\'s view of the other side\\'s Medicare Advantage\\nplan\"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.\\nWhile senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits\\nfrom lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.\\nEach senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same\\nmorning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing\\ncan barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it\\'s an unwritten\\nrule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend\\nfour days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their\\nhome states, where they return most weekends, even if it\\'s to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and\\nto the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he\\ntold new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,\\n\"When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there\\nwas Wednesday afternoon.\"\\nNothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, \"Of any free time\\nyou have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more,\" is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own\\ncampaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on\\nbehalf of the Party (in the Democrats\\' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate\\noffice buildings, since they\\'re barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee\\nRepublican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, \"It sucks up time that a\\nsenator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues.\"\\nIn June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time\\nto meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million\\ndollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups\\nwere spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising\\nand lobbying, said, \"People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills\\nare not nearly as bold because of the influence of money.\"\\nDeschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: \"Sometimes, you\\'re dialling for dollars,\\nyou get the call, you\\'ve got to get over to vote, you\\'ve got fifteen minutes. You don\\'t have a clue what\\'s on the floor, your\\nstaff is whispering in your ears, you\\'re running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but,\\njust to make triple sure, there\\'s a little sheet of paper on the clerk\\'s table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no\\nvote. So you\\'ve got all these checks just to make sure you don\\'t screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if\\nyou\\'re ever pressed, \\'Why did you vote that way?\\'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because\\nI don\\'t have a clue.\"\\nAides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few\\ndecades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,\\nwho are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to\\npush senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating\\nthe details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox\\' or MSNBC.\\nOne day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. \"You know about all\\nthese rags that cover the Hill, right?\" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,\\nand CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of\\nthe \"24/7 media,\" provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a \"dust-up\" between Scott\\nBrown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;\\nthe staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the\\nSenate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a young\\npress aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of political\\nobsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreported\\nbecause their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in\\n1981 and will leave next January, told me, \"I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on a\\ndaily basis. I don\\'t have one today, and haven\\'t had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see me\\nthrough the prism of conflict.\" Lamar Alexander described the effect as \"this instant radicalizing of positions to the left and\\nthe right.\"\\nBoth Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly\\nfifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still\\npermissible. \"A lot of senators don\\'t understand the history or tradition of the institution,\" Gregg said. \"Substantive,\\nthoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside.\"\\nEncumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunch\\nto the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one\\nanother—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses\\nwho live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill\\nCooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women\\'s social club. It remains the only time Udall has\\nset foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the\\nseventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: \"In those days Democrats and\\nRepublicans actually enjoyed each other\\'s company.\") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim\\nDeMint, Dodd said, \"Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well.\" He repeated something that Jon\\nKyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: \"There\\'s no trust.\" Dodd, whose father was a senator,\\nwent on, \"That\\'s really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don\\'t think anyone would argue with that\\nconclusion. And if that\\'s missing.\\nThere remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as\\n\"friends.\" Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as \"one of my best friends in the Senate,\" and\\nboth Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with\\nDemocrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall\\nnoted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to\\nbond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the \"inner sanctum,\" where\\nRepublicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls\\nsuch as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. \"You\\nlearned, and also you found out what was going on,\" Dodd said, adding, \"It\\'s awfully difficult to say crappy things about\\nsomeone that you just had lunch with.\" These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their\\nrespective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else \"downtown,\" which means asking donors for money over\\nsteak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the \"caucus lunch\" was instituted by Republicans in\\nthe fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work\\nmembers on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry\\nReid as an idiot. \"At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,\" Alexander joked, adding, \"We spend most of\\nour time in team meetings deciding what we\\'re going to do to each other.\"\\nIn 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. \"They kind of dwindled off during the\\nhealth-care debate,\" Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few\\nmonths, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,\\njoking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.\\nThese efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers\\nwho try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of\\nWisconsin, put it this way: \"Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?\"\\nThe upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.\\nThe Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.\\nFor some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a\\nlevelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply\\nimpressed by the quality of its members: \"They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts\\nanimating it, not the petty passions.\" But he also recognized that \"a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could\\ncompletely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of\\nconstitutional government.\" As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America\\'s most talented statesmen,\\nTocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.\\nRobert A. Caro, in \"Master of the Senate,\" the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •\\nthe Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, Henry\\nClay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies of\\nWoodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists\\nand Republican corporate shills, and was \"the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—\\nthe chief obstructive force in the federal government.\" By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than\\nthe public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book \"Citadel,\" called the Senate \"to a most peculiar\\ndegree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly\" and \"the only place in the\\ncountry where the South did not lose the war.\"\\nBy mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger\\'s 1962 film \"Advise and\\nConsent,\" based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and\\nRepublicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in\\nits way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one\\nanother in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,\\nno media, no constituents—only senators\\' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.\\nIn a memoir, Johnson\\'s longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate\\'s \"famous \\'club\\' atmosphere is\\nbased on the members\\' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard\\nat one another in debate over serious matters,\" but, he writes, \"understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course\\nof the Senate day was essential to sanity.\" Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his\\nwill and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either \"whales\"—the heavyweight chairmen who\\nnegotiated legislation—or \"minnows,\" the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a\\nformidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip\\nHart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of \"The Fall of the House of\\nRoosevelt,\" worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. \"They used to talk to each other—that\\'s my most\\nvivid recollection,\" he said. \"If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in to\\nhear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body,\\ndrawing each other out—sometimes pedantically.\" Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, social\\nwelfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. \"But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanism\\nby which you could do it,\" Janeway said.\\nIn the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and\\nmoderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of\\nthose decades as \"a bipartisan liberal institution.\" The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the\\nRepublican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,\\ncampaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed\\njointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed,\\nin 1965, it won 70-24.\\nThe Senate\\'s momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,\\nHoward Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan \"field\\nhearings\" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole\\'s indispensable support,\\ngreatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today\\'s\\nlegislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and\\nsaid, \"You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That\\'s how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That\\'s\\nhow you demonstrate your bona fides. Don\\'t be a gadfly.\" Humphrey\\'s career advice: \"You should become Mr. Housing.\\nHousing is the future.\"\\nThe Senate\\'s modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and\\naccelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. \"The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of\\npeople just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs,\" Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. \"They\\nwere harder-line. They weren\\'t there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to\\nRepublicans in the Senate today.\" Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,\\nwho is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, \"It was a huge loss of the most experienced,\\naccomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there\\nless than six years.\" He added, \"The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets\\nworse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: \\'Others\\ndidn\\'t want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.\\'\"\\nAfter C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals\\nbegan to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. \"So Damn Much Money,\" a recent book by the Washington Post\\nreporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans\\nbegan to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan\\ncoalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own\\nfund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members\\nof both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to\\nregularly using the Senate\\'s rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in\\nthe eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and\\nescalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats\\nfilibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-\\ncalled \"nuclear option.\" Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went to\\nSouth Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years\\nearlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.\\nThe weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,\\nindependent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every\\nelection had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate,\\nno longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action was\\nbetween the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican Senate\\nmajority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.\\nNorman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly\\nbecome populated by \"ideologues and charlatans.\" He went on, \"When we do get good people who come in, they very\\nquickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay\\nthere.\" He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year\\nworking closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with\\nangry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about \"pulling the plug on\\nGrandma.\" Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin \"altering his behavior and abandoning\\nevery issue, including campaign-finance reform.\"\\nOne morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.\\nA. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm\\'s spiral-bound directory for the\\n111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger\\ndown the list of senators. He did it again. \"I\\'m trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this.\" He\\nwas stumped. \"Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time.\" He\\nput the directory aside. \"I\\'m just having the damnedest time.\"\\nDown the hall from McPherson\\'s office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired\\nlast year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to\\nJPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom\\nDaschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm\\'s chairman, until\\nPresident Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with\\nwhich he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became lobbyists.\\nIn 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned and formed\\na lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year\\nwaiting period between serving and lobbying.\\nWhen you spend your days at the Senate, it\\'s easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems\\nmiles away (it\\'s just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign\\ncountries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute\\nthirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution\\nAvenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors\\' gallery says \"Men\\'s Gallery\"), and\\nthe Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where\\nsenators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over\\nthe institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.\\nRiddick, called \"Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices,\" which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was\\nknown to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding\\nofficer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.\\nAfter half a century, the picture given by Preminger\\'s \"Advise and Consent\" is still faintly visible. \"The Senate, by its\\nnature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount,\" Lamar Alexander said. \"And that\\'s\\nnot changed.\" Which is exactly the problem: it\\'s a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its\\nmembers to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, \"To have a chamber\\nthat rules by unanimous consent—it\\'s nutty! Especially when you\\'ve got Jim Bunning to please.\"\\nIn 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one\\n(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia; liberals,\\nlike Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of\\nMinnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of\\nsenior senators. \"If they can stay, I think they\\'ll be terrific,\" Chris Dodd said. \"My worry is they won\\'t stay. Because it\\'s not\\nproductive.\"\\nThe Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead, their\\nyoung Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and \"secret holds\"—when a senator\\nanonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire\\nMcCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds, and\\nJon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship\\nbetween the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael\\nBennet said, \"We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small ones, and where\\nthings have been put off for a really long period of time.\" He mentioned the national debt, energy policy, and the financial\\ncrisis. \"Yet you have a Senate that\\'s designed not to advance change but to slow it.\"\\nWe were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled\\nwater, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl\\'s mouth was moving.\\nBennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already has to\\ndefend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn\\'t allowed himself to grow too\\nattached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: \"And then some\\nmore veteran guy came over and said, \\'Son, you\\'re talking like this place is on the level. It\\'s not on the level.\\' As the fifteen\\nmonths or so have gone by that I\\'ve been here, the less on the level it seems.\"\\nEarlier this year, the Senate\\'s procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,\\nCon gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy\\nObama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office\\nmaintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent several\\ndays and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed\\nAmericans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, \"Tough shit.\" (Eventually, Republicans persuaded\\nBunning to stop.)\\nThese incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate\\'s routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,\\nGrassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In\\n2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more\\nsenators can pass the hold back and forth—it\\'s called \"rolling holds\"—and their party leader facilitates the game by\\nkeeping their names secret.\\nMany of the Senate\\'s antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of\\npartisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed\\ntime to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-\\nauthored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used rule\\nthat allowed the \"previous question\" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by the\\neighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking\\nuntil their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word \"filibuster\\' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for \"looter.\")\\nIn 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,\\nwhich allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a \"cloture\" vote. For decades, the rule was rarely\\nused; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies and\\neighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower the\\nthreshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year, as\\nboth parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost\\ntheir majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and\\n2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.\\nThe tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed\\nby the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. \"Why?\" Steny Hoyer, the outraged\\nDemocratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. \"Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates\\nnoncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate.\" Last week, six House\\nDemocrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.\\nSeventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,\\nhaven\\'t come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the\\nObama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)\\nThere\\'s often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to run\\nthe General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection was\\nsubstantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick\\'s \"Senate Procedure\" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.\\nJudd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud\\nof an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist; Senate\\nclerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.\\nUnder McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate\\'s calendar as possible with legislative\\nmaneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate\\'s agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first\\nproposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues \"nihilists,\" who want to create chaos because it\\nserves their ideology. \"If there\\'s chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions,\" Harkin said. \"In chaos people don\\'t listen\\nto reason.\" McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican strategy\\nreflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, \"To the extent that they\"—the Democrats—\\n\"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we\\'ll be helpful. To the\\nextent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful.\"\\nOne of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after vote.\\nWhy do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana; Susan\\nCollins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander\\nsaid that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, \"When you have your back against the wall and the gallows\\nare hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind.\"\\nLindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: \"He said\\nif we didn\\'t stick together on big things, we wouldn\\'t be relevant.\" Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster a\\nmilitary-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad\\nCochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that\\nhe wouldn\\'t join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings\\ndisproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn\\'t allow him to vote with\\nthe Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture,\\nand the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)\\nRepublican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus\\nbill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee\\'s health-care-\\nreform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against the\\nversion that went before the full Senate. \"I wasn\\'t interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee\\nversion—it grew by a thousand pages,\" Snowe said. She wasn\\'t included in the negotiations with White House officials\\nthat took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid\\'s suite of offices, and said that the Democrats \"did not\\naccept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch.\" McConnell was able to exploit her\\nalienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: \"She actually said to me once that she had never felt\\nthe pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or\\ntroubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like \\'You just can\\'t let us down, we\\'re all in this together. You\\'re a senior\\nRepublican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you\\'re going to do it.\\' \"\\nReid doesn\\'t use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the senator\\nwho helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly\\nmaneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn\\'t give him the leverage\\nof McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.\\nIn the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent\\nof the country\\'s population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new\\nsenators have considered a radical option: mutiny.\\nTom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow\\'s-feet of a Westerner who has spent\\ntime in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior\\nSecretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is\\na freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,\\nin 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.\\n\"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas,\" he said. \"Then to be on the inside—the thing\\nthat strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show.\"\\nIn his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate\\'s rules.\\nCustomarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend\\nthem, making it extremely difficult. (\"Rule XXII is a Catch-22,\" Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different\\nidea—the \"constitutional option.\" Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that \"each House may determine the Rules\\nof its Proceedings\" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January and\\npropose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There\\'s\\neven a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times,\\nmost recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.\\nAt the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings\\non the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when\\nthe constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized working\\ngroups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by\\ncaucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing\\nfor the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority\\nLeader.)\\nFor Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. \"If you want a\\nparliamentary form of government, go over to the House,\" Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. \"Why even run for the\\nSenate?\" Udall\\'s plan for next January, he said, would be a \"gigantic mistake.\"\\n\"They\\'ll get over it,\" Alexander said of the Democrats\\' enthusiasm for rules reform. \"And they\\'ll get over it quicker if they\\'re\\nin the minority next January. Because they\\'ll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they\\nhave to say.\" He added that the Senate \"may be getting done about as much as the American people want done.\" The\\nPresident\\'s ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I\\nspoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is \"broken.\" Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were\\nexercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. \"The Senate wasn\\'t\\ncreated to be efficient,\" he argued. \"It was created to be inefficient.\" At one of the filibuster hearings, in April, Alexander,\\nsitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing\\nlegislation, \"we could say that\\'s the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate, our right to offer\\namendments, which is the essence of the Senate.\"\\nNewcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is\\ninevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution\\'s intransigence. According to Sarah Binder,\\na change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, and\\nso would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. \"I would oppose that,\" Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen,\\n\"These are people who have never been in the minority.\" For older Democrats, who have put in their years, grown adept\\nat working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators,\\nthe sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between\\nwhales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senate\\'s\\nways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the\\nnewer radicals who now dominate the caucus.\\nEven if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,\\nwasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,\\nwho have created a culture where Tocqueville\\'s \"lofty thoughts\" and \"generous impulses\" have no place.\\nA few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial\\nregulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win\\nreal bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout\\nWall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs\\nappeared before Senator Levin\\'s subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and\\nevasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to\\npass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.\\nThe affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first\\nterm, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of\\nChattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of\\nVirginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to\\ndo with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked\\nthrough the winter, in Warner\\'s office, in Corker\\'s office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members of\\na Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, Alan\\nGreenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still\\ntalking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate\\'s \"Odd Couple.\" By February, they had finished\\ntheir work.\\nMeanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,\\ndragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the\\ncommittee\\'s junior members, agreed to be the chairman\\'s Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed\\nMcConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. \"It was an odd place to be,\" Corker recalled. \"And yet that night we\\nbegan meeting.\" The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In\\nresponse, Shelby\\'s conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists\\nthat he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the\\nParty\\'s line on financial reform.)\\nOn March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, \"You\\'ve been a great\\npartner.\" He was ending their talks after only a month. \"It\\'s a little stunning, I\\'ve got to be honest,\" Corker told reporters\\nafterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens\\'s Miss Havisham, unable to get over the\\nrebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks\\nunder pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other\\nRepublicans with him. \"Baloney,\" Corker said. \"If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we\\'d\\'ve had at least twenty-\\nfive Republican votes.\"\\nThe bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,\\nincorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund,\\npaid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.\\nBut in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parroting\\ntalking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a \"partisan bill\" that \"will guarantee\\nperpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks.\" McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one Republicans,\\nsuggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.\\nHis remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker\\'s work as well as of Dodd\\'s. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded\\nwith his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, \"Let\\'s come to the floor and let\\'s act like adults. Let\\'s tone down the rhetoric.\\nLet\\'s don\\'t exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let\\'s do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be\\nthe people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler\\nheads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that on\\nfinancial regulation, an issue that really doesn\\'t have any real philosophical bearings to it . . .\" Corker didn\\'t allow the\\nthought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.\\nDodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker\\'s speech: \"I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced\\nwith a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I am\\nnot naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can\\'t act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why\\nare we even here?\" He went on, \"We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out\\nfor their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent\\non proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends\\nof mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part of\\nthe solution.\"\\nIn the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he\\nchopped the air with his hand as he shouted, \"I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four or\\nfive months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have\\nto say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!\"\\nCorker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. \"You and I went a long\\nway,\" Corker told Dodd. \"Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats\\non your committee.\"\\n\"And I was not gaining Republicans,\" Dodd replied.\\n\"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did\\nnot leave the table.\" Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few\\ndays.\\nBut this was not McConnell\\'s agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-\\nreform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists\\nprowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the ornate\\nReception Room with Jim Manley, Reid\\'s spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of furniture\\nscraping across a tile floor. \"Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room,\" Manley said. \"Very little happens around\\nhere without a deadline.\" The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks\\nlater, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to a\\nvote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn\\'t among them. He had even voted for\\nan amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker\\'s work\\nof many months with Warner.\\n\"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!\" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained\\noffice, under a print of Holbein\\'s portrait of Thomas More. \"It\\'s the Senate, I guess.\" McConnell\\'s strategy of obstruction\\nhad once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a \"shrinking number\" of Republicans were\\nfrustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, \"God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking\\nmember on this.\" Collins responded, \"We could have had such a great time on this bill.\"\\nWarner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because \"the American people don\\'t trust either political party enough\\nto give them a blank check,\" was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. \"There was zero\\nsubstantive reason why this couldn\\'t have been eighty votes,\" he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the\\nbill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, \"If you want to vote against something, you\\ncan always find your reasons.\"\\nBut Corker hadn\\'t seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating\\nhimself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty\\nminutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. \"I am obviously disappointed,\" he said. \"I think I have spent as\\nmuch time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in\\nit. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough time\\nwas spent on some of the core issues.\"\\nAs the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of \"So Damn Much Money,\" in the press gallery. I later\\nasked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of the\\nSenate. \"If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away money\\nand interest groups,\" he said. \"But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things\\nconsidered, it\\'s better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here\\nyou\\'ve arrived in the United States Senate and you can\\'t do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet.\"\\nAfter the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,\\nsmiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, \"For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it\\ndidn\\'t work.\" He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with \"some Nevadans.\"\\nDurbin said, \"I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take\\nto bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?\"\\nDodd, glowing with triumph, said, \"I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its\\nbusiness much as our founders intended. We did that.\"\\nOn July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial\\nregulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They\\ndepended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,\\nand a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,\\nHarry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.\\nAnd so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans\\' care, campaign finance,\\ntransportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on\\nthe list of matters that the world\\'s greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you can feel the Senate\\nslipping back into stagnant waters.\\nILLUSTRATION: STEVE BRODNER\\n• Print\\n• E-Mail\\n• Feeds\\nShare:\\n• Facebook\\n• Twitter\\n• Digg\\n• More\\nTo get more of The New Yorker\\'s signature mix of politics, culture and the arts: Subscribe now\\nRelated Links\\nAsk the Author: Join a live chat with George Packer about the Senate on Wednesday, August 4, at 3 P.M.

Rice, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, on Secretary\\nGeneral Ban\\'s Panel Concerning the May 31 Flotilla Incident\\nThe United States welcomes today\\'s announcement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the\\nestablishment of a Panel regarding the incident of May 31st- We thank both governments for the constructive\\nand cooperative spirit they have shown and the Secretary General for his leadership and determination. The\\nPanel, which has the support of both Israel and Turkey, will receive and review the reports of each\\ngovernment\\'s national investigation into the incident and make recommendations as to how to avoid such\\nincidents in the future. This Panel is not a substitute for those national investigations. It complements them,\\naffording Israel and Turkey the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the international\\ncommunity. The focus of the Panel is appropriately on the future and on preventing such incidents from\\nrecurring. The United States also hopes that the Panel can serve as a vehicle to enable Israel and Turkey to\\nmove beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties.\\nThe United States expects that the Panel will operate in a transparent and credible manner and that its work will\\nbe the primary method for the international community to review the incident, obviating the need for any\\noverlapping international inquiries. The United States welcomes the naming of the former Prime Minister of\\nNew Zealand, Geoffrey Palmer, as Chair and the outgoing President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, as Vice-Chair.\\nWe look forward to the announcement of the two additional members from Israel and Turkey.\\n###\\nThis email is UNCLASSIFIED.\\nThis email is UNCLASSIFIED.FyiDuring the past year we have discussed the size of the Germany PD budget and the fact that it did not reflect current\\npriorities. EUR reviewed the budget and made the decision to cut the German PD budget by 30% and reallocate the\\nfunding to other areas, primarily Eastern Europe. As you will see from the email below and the attached memo, Mission\\nGermany responded by reviewing all their PD operations and developing an entirely new approach based on the PD\\nstrategic framework we rolled out earlier this year.

We have received commitments from both sides, and we have made assurances to\\nboth sides, that are enabling us to move forward.

I trust that we are keeping well. I just want to use this opportunity to say that today\\nwe come to the end of the program here on the President\\'s Forum. All along this Forum and especially during the White\\nHouse meeting with President Obama, I have been asking myself what it means to be here in DC and to be representing\\nCameroon at this forum?\\nI have recently come to the realization that the time is critical and that President Obama in his thinking about a new\\nAfrica believes that young people whom we are, diverse and intelligently different can take little positive actions to\\nensure that the next 50 years witnesses significant changes in our social processes, our political institutions, processes\\nand structures, our economic freedom, taking into consideration our cultural specificities.\\nWhile traveling to America, I kept imagining the moment when President Obama would tell us great and magical ways to\\ngetting out of our current socio-economic and especially political hostage situations, but in all and after all the speeches,\\nconversations and interactions with Ordinary Americans like in the Southside of Washington DC, State Department Staff,\\nSenators, Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, I noticed that America can only partner with us when we\\ndecide to start thinking and acting differently in our quest for a better Cameroon and a better Africa.\\nThis thinking differently is exemplified by the American Peace Corps, in the service leadership, the spirit of give back to\\nthe nation and community and the transformation of challenges to opportunities in America and in many nations\\naround the world...\\nWhen our troubles and challenges seems gruesome and our vision blurred by the thought and fear of the unknown if we\\ndared, the one thing I come out with from this Forum is this, \"That we just have to Think, Speak out and above all, DARE\\ntake some innovative ACTIONs to Be the change we want to see in our communities, nations and continent and commit\\nothers to same by our examples...That we have to build strong networks and undertake advocacies as a group as\\nnothing has ever stopped a committed group of people to drive change aound the world.\\nThe work to be done is enormous and challenging but sure the reward of every success like coming to America, to the\\nWhite House and meeting with President Obama is sweet.

Sid\\nGordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems.\\nClegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls,\\nand Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations\\nbetween Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating.\\nBoth offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike\\na deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right\\nnow. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power.\\nCameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable,\\neven given Gordon\\'s political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD\\nnegotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition\\nthat would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon\\'s heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the\\nLDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. SidI am traveling overseas, with only intermittent access to my email.

Born in 1962 and\\nhailing from the Bogeka clan, VM Momoima has lived in Otamba, Nyamataro, Mosocho and Nairobi. In 1982, following\\nthe failed Kenyan coup d\\'etat attempt to overthrow President Daniel Arap Moi\\'s government, VM Momoima was among\\nthe 900 people that were jailed. However, in 1984, he returned to the University of Nairobi and graduated with a\\nBachelors degree in commerce a year later. After graduation, VM Momoima attended North Carolina State University\\nwhere he graduated with a Masters degree in management. He returned to Kenya in 1992 during the first multi party\\nelections to help his father (then incumbent MP for Kitutu Chache and Minister for Planning and National Development)\\nwho was seeking re-election on a KANU (Kenya African National Union) ticket. VM Momoima\\'s first political opportunity\\narose when his father passed away in 1996, which prompted an election in which he lost to a new corner during the\\nparty (KANU) nominations. Since the Kenyan parliamentary election in 2007, VM Momoima has represented the Kitutu\\nChache Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya.\\nA financial economist by profession, VM Momoima currently runs personal businesses in Nairobi and Kisii and has held\\npositions in the Kisii KANU branch.

So how\\ncome we haven\\'t?\\nBY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010\\nOne day in November 2009, in Helmand province\\'s capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees met\\nwith Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for International\\nDevelopment (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently,\\nnone of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk of\\nbeing killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring and\\nbasic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.\\nCOMMENTS (22) SHARE:\\nTwitter\\nReddit\\nBuzz\\nEMore...\\nAs Patricia prepared to leave, the women fluttered around her like moths, touching her sleeves and speaking all at once.\\n\\'What are they saying?\" Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. \"They are telling you to go back to your\\ncountry and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don\\'t want you to leave. They will quite\\nliterally die if the Taliban return,\" she said.\\nIn a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities, Brigham Young, a student asked Gen. David Petraeus\\nwhether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate \"reformed\"\\nTaliban into governance structures as the Americans leave.\\nCarefully avoiding the word \"women,\" the general assured the questioning student that only \"moderate\" Taliban would be\\neligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of \"moderate,\" which clearly depends on where you sit:\\nIf you sit in a burqa, there is no such thing as a \"moderate\" Taliban.\\nPetraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistan\\'s women once the \"moderate\"\\nTaliban come back, but it\\'s likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no security -- and\\nuntil we\\'ve done more to protect it, we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan.\\nIn 2001, George W. Bush\\'s administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school and\\nof Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land. A few\\nmonths after the invasion, in his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush announced, \"The last time we met in this\\nchamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to\\nschool. Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan\\'s new government.\"\\nThe Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. They\\nstrong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are not\\ntreated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras, and USAID ripped a\\npage from Greg Mortenson\\'s Three Cups of Tea and facilitated new training and educational opportunities for women.\\nBut the current administration, despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Women\\'s Issues, appears\\nto be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any sustained\\nrhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in Afghanistan. Since\\nthen, and especially since last year\\'s Afghan election, those fine words from a sitting president have all but disappeared.\\nMany of the fine actions are gone, too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push local shuras into\\nincluding women in 2010? Forget it.\\nIt\\'s not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stages\\nof the occupation have come home to roost. President Hamid Karzai and his rogue\\'s gallery of kleptocrats, human rights\\nabusers, and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by accusing\\nsenior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power.\\nIn the meantime, women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But their\\nsuffering is real, as Afghanistan\\'s poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Matemal mortality in Afghanistan\\nstill makes the world\\'s top three list, nine years after the U.S. invasion, resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. In\\nthe countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid into girls\\' faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in the\\nfirst place. According to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women, 87 percent of Afghan women report\\nbeing beaten on a regular basis.\\nIn July of last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report that represents the most stinging\\nofficial condemnation of the Karzai administration\\'s abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded, \"The\\ncurrent reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course of\\nseeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them.\" Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who --\\nbefore witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. Her husband, who had battled for redress, was assassinated\\nsoon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain death\\nwhile their murderers face 100 percent impunity.\\nFor the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government, the issue of gender equality\\nwas always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through the\\ndeployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Women\\'s Affairs.\\nIndeed, just before his recent \"election,\" Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive measures\\ndesigned to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster.\\nAlthough eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives, Karzai\\nsuccessfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits women\\'s rights to inherit, divorce, or have\\nguardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage and the rape of minors.\\nIt allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the power to prohibit women\\'s access to\\nwork, education, and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes except for \"legitimate\" purposes. Even\\nKarzai\\'s own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly sequestered. And if this sounds bad, just\\nwait until the Americans leave.\\nThis is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women, but boys and men. In Afghanistan,\\nbecause women are rarely able to leave the house, very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount of\\nfinancial responsibility, something that limits their prospects as well.\\nNor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in March, \"The subjugation of women is a\\nthreat to the national security of the United States.\" On a geopolitical level, Valerie\\'s research has found that states with\\nhigher levels of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence against women is a better\\npredictor of bellicosity than level of democracy, level of wealth, or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study, Valerie,\\nalong with Brad Thayer, also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development of\\nIslamic suicide terrorism.\\nSo, given the desperate need of Afghanistan\\'s women and the serious consequences worldwide, why aren\\'t we doing\\nmore to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan \"culture\" does not\\nallow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from one\\ncoalition representative, who prefers to remain anonymous: \\'There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will only\\nalienate them [Afghans].\" Of course, \"them\" here refers only to men.\\nBut decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed, but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago, Afghan\\nwomen were attending universities, teaching, working as doctors, nurses, and professors. Far from being a black hole of\\ngender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors.\\nFurthermore, many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009, hundreds of Afghan men and women\\nbravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzai\\'s support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans\\nassume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong.\\nAnother, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life,\\ndespite increasing female recruitment and even \"female engagement teams,\" remains a bastion of masculinity, with little\\nsensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike, immured as they are in an almost\\nexclusively male world, the complete absence of women from Afghanistan\\'s streets and villages elicited no comment from\\nthe Marines who surrounded Pat, though she as a woman noticed it immediately.\\nAnd the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases, coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West, not only\\ndamages prospects for gender equality but by extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old\\nAfghan male pointed out, \"Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you exploit\\nwomen in ways that we can\\'t even imagine. Do you call that progress?\" Added another Afghan USAID programmer\\nworking in Gardez, a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls, \"It would be better for the coalition if they could figure\\nout a way to limit this kind of material.\"\\nWe can do better -- much better.\\nThe Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protecting\\nwomen\\'s rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security.\\nThe military should spend less time courting \"moderate\" Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders how\\ngender equality -- including female access to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families, lower maternal\\nand child death rates, poverty alleviation, and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a component in all\\ngovernance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming \"peace jirga\" that will include the Taliban.\\nIndeed, let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female: yes, a full 50 percent.\\nWomen must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador at large for global women\\'s\\nissues, noted last summer, speaking of female politicians in Afghanistan, \"There is only one minister in the cabinet, and\\nshe is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the civil service. There is only one female governor, in\\nBamiyan.\" Obama must insist on important changes for women before we leave and make subsequent aid contingent\\nupon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan government.\\nBetter yet, the coalition needs to support \"regime change\" through the building of democratic institutions that will groom a\\nmoderate, educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the Afghan\\npopulation is under the age of 25, which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and given a\\nchance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle, if they find themselves without jobs, unable to\\nmarry, and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female.\\nWe must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of\\nDiscrimination against Women (CEDAVV) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and\\nsecurity. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, has not), and that means that it\\nhas committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equality\\nenshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights and\\nfundamental freedoms as men, having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women, taking\\nmeasures to eliminate sexist discrimination, and lastly, submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisory\\ngroup of international experts, the CEDAW Committee, to ensure transparency on what measures the country has taken\\nto implement the treaty\\'s provisions.\\nUnanimously adopted in 2000, UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate and\\nunique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as active\\nagents in peace and security.\\nNeedless to say, women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men, and indeed, with the passing of\\nthe Shiite family law, many are worse off than they were before.\\nTo change this, the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistan\\nand the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an existence\\nnot fit for animals.\\nWe are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off\\n(Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America\\'s track record, women around the world should have\\nno faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton\\'s remarks on the link between gender equality and\\nsecurity, on the ground Americans act as if women\\'s well-being, in the end, is not more than peripherally related to the\\nissue of peace. As we have seen, this view could not be more wrong. Verveer\\'s benchmarks concerning Afghanistan are\\nthe right ones: \"Progress in Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms, but also in terms of social, political,\\nand economic participation of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights.\"\\nAmerican women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women can\\ncontinue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women, you break faith\\nwith American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place.\\nSave bio when you subscribe to FP.\\nMajid Saeedi/Getty ImageMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nWednesday, May 12, 2010 1:22 PM\\nFW: Haiti MDTF Contribution of $55M!\\nfyiYes lona has it on listFedEx to my house\\nRELEASE IN PART B6Compliment for you.

Bardy, at the Seattle\\nInstitute for Cardiac Research in Seattle. And in the study in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Bardy and other\\nresearchers reported that initial trials of such a device in patients were successful.\\nDefibrillators fire an electrical jolt to interrupt a potentially fatal heart rhythm and restore normal beating. For a unit to\\nfunction, a surgeon must thread an electrical sensing wire through a blood vessel into a patient\\'s heart. The wires pose\\nrisks because they can, on rare occasion, puncture the heart during implantation or fracture while in place.\\nThe new version delivers the electrical jolt by means of a sensor implanted under the skin near the chest bone. A power\\nunit is placed under the skin on the side of the chest.\\nThe new device is already for sale in some European countries, but Dr. Bardy and others cautioned that full-scale, long-\\nterm trials were still needed to prove the implant\\'s worth to the Food and Drug Administration. Even if successful, the\\nunit could not be used by all patients who needed a defibrillator, but several researchers said they were excited by the new\\nstudy nonetheless.\\nDr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could\\nsomeday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a\\ndefibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out.\\nIn recent years, the safety of defibrillator wires has come in particular focus because a model made by Medtronic has been\\nprone to fracturing. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also,\\nscar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or\\ndangerous.\\nDr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries\\nwere a factor in his interest in developing the new device.\\n\"You are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,\" he said.\\nIn the study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successful\\ninitial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.\\nThe device is being developed by Cameron Health, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr.\\nBardy. Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gone\\nthrough several iterations.\\nThe device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that also\\ninclude a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.\\nBut Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These are\\nlargely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythm\\nthat can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator.\\nHowever, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.\\nBefore the device can be sold here, Cameron Health will have to submit more extensive human trial data to theF.D.A.. Dr.\\nBardy said a larger study of the device has just begun in this country and overseas and that it will most likely take a year or\\nmore to assemble data from it for the agency\\'s review.August 8, 2010\\nGary Sick\\nAmerica and Iran: Strikes, Sanctions and Scapegoats\\nFor the pundits, there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israel\\nand/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to change\\nits nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues, the answers are an easy no and no.\\nNeither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table, thereby giving the pundits (and the\\ncrowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages,\\nwhere it has been for years. As a lede, it sells columns and newspapers, so it will not go away. But as analysis it\\nis either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment.\\nUber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur, it would have been at the end of the Bush\\nadministration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted it\\nunequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging from his\\nsubsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush, after looking the potential\\nconsequences, resisted the advice of his neocon advisers, his previously dominant vice president, and the\\nreported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that Barack\\nObama, with the same catastrophic scenario before him, will approve? Forget it.\\nSanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their security\\nand survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraq\\nin the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out of\\nIraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq had\\nabandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people and\\nhis enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him.\\nOne of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that there\\nwas no immediate necessity to come clean. They, after all, controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmen\\nmanaged the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people, a rotund\\nTariq Aziz, sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar, informed a worried UN representative that it would be\\ngood for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions had\\nmade criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class, which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. The\\nbiggest – and most successful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddam\\nHussein.\\nWhich brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web of\\nfinancial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significant\\nproblems for the leadership. Iran\\'s critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because of\\ncheap energy prices inside the country, artificially propped up by massive subsidies, energy demand is soaring.\\nThis siphons off a lot of Iran\\'s oil production, which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hard\\ncurrency.\\nAt the same time, because Iran\\'s oil fields are old and complex, they require modern technology to maintain\\nproduction. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oil\\ncompanies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions, ironically assisted by\\nIran\\'s own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outside\\ninvestors. As a result, Iran\\'s oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soaked\\nup by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices, this means that Iran\\'s hard currency\\nearnings are drying up at an alarming rate.\\nThis unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competent\\neconomic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene\\'i, the Supreme Leader,\\nseems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the Revolutionary\\nGuards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah\\'s regime\\ncould have imagined.\\nPresident Ahmadinejad, also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards, is free to indulge his taste for outlandish\\nand irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effect\\ndrives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctions\\nagainst Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossad\\nagent: no one, he observed, had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At the\\nsame time, under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits.\\nBut to be fair, Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the \"third rail\" of\\nIranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount of\\nsubsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation, including torching filling stations.\\nBut these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran\\'s energy dilemma. He is now\\naddressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage, including closing\\nthe bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress.\\nThese are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer, including the\\nInternational Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economic\\ninterests by his belligerent rhetoric, always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembles\\nhis populist predecessors, from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America and\\nIsrael the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists, Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of his\\nown eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them.\\nThe key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iran\\nis capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. The\\nRevolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran\\'s military, its economy, and its politics. Iran\\nincreasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and \\'30s that\\nwe call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons, from the millenarians on the far right\\nwho choose to believe that Khamene\\'i is the personal representative of God on earth, to the pragmatic\\nconservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership, to the reformists of the Green movement whose\\nobjective is to put the \"republic\" back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice.\\nThis is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next.\\nAnd this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration will\\nback the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied with\\ndomestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it will\\ninadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoat\\nfor everything that goes wrong in Iran.I remember what I was going to say earlier — you might check in with Steve Bosworth on the Spanta thing.

We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who garnered international attention\\nfor her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning,\\nher fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi, an 18-year old charged with\\nhomosexuality, faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation.

The city\\'s big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin\\'s\\nmarriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White House insiders stayed away.\\nWell, as Bill Clinton told CNN recently, \"I did everything I could to defeat President Obama and I wanted Hillary to win\" —\\nold wounds do not heal overnight. Indeed, they may not heal at all. When my informant said something about the old\\ngrievances not going away, the response from the hosts went something like this:\\nNo, they don\\'t and they never will. But, we\\'re public servants and suckers for punishment, so we soldier on.\\nSpeaking of soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left for Europe the next day and while Americans celebrated July 4, she was in\\nArmenia trying to sort out the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.— equally thankless task — mediate between Armenia and\\nTurkey on their disagreement over what happened in 1915.\\nYou\\'ve got to salute Hillary. She\\'s got guts to go with that razor-sharp mind. It\\'s a heck of a job being secretary of state\\nwhen the White House puts a tight collar around the big issues — Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Iraq — and\\nyou\\'re left with Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes of World War I and, if you\\'re lucky, U.S. bases on Okinawa.\\nThe situation might be slightly less troubling if the boys in the White House — and they are overwhelmingly boys — were\\nforeign-policy heavyweights. They\\'re not. Indeed, I\\'m told Henry Kissinger refers to them as \"the kids.\"\\nChief among them, according to my colleague Helene Cooper, is Denis McDonough, the National Security Council\\'s chief\\nof staff. Earlier this month, Cooper wrote: \"Forget Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or Defense Secretary Robert\\nM. Gates. When it comes to national security, Mr. Obama\\'s inner circle is so tight it largely consists of Mr. McDonough, a\\n40-year-old from Minnesota who is unknown to most Americans.\"\\nI do know McDonough and I\\'ve spent a fair amount of time in Minnesota. He has many of the state\\'s qualities: positive,\\nbrisk, can-do, affable and efficient.\\nBut am I reassured when! read that Obama\\'s national-security inner circle is comprised of him? Nope. He was a great\\nguy to control the foreign-policy side of a campaign — as he did to perfection for Obama — but he\\'s not a great guy to\\nthink big about the world.\\nThinking big and bold is required right now. The clock is ticking on momentous presidential decisions. Among them are an\\nAfghan extrication that will salvage a minimum of core U.S. security interests — which will require a bruising negotiation\\nwith the Taliban — and what to do about Iran when it becomes apparent by the end of this year that the latest sanctions\\nhave changed nothing. Obama\\'s apparent carte blanche to Israel this month on Iran was disturbing.\\nThen there\\'s Israel-Palestine, where Obama can\\'t decide whether the cost of being an honest broker pressure on both\\nsides — is worth the domestic heat he takes for being critical of Israel, with the result that he\\'s zigzagging to little effect.\\nAfter firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said he would tolerate debate but not division. My sense is his foreign-\\npolicy house is divided — and the weaker for it. Gen. James Jones, his national security adviser, speaks fine French —\\nthe French love that — but he\\'s left most people unconvinced. Tom Donilon, Jones\\' deputy, dances around the vacuum\\nas best he can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod and Rehm Emanuel were brilliant campaign strategists, but should they\\nbe foreign-policy strategists?\\nIn Clinton, Obama has a Baker-class secretary of state. For how much longer is he going to delegate her to Nagorno-\\nKarabakh? The State Department, a repository of Other underused talent, cannot be the White House annex for non-\\ncritical affairs.\\nBack in the 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, then the editor of the New York Herald, a forebear of the International Herald\\nTribune, gave these instructions to an intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley:\\n\"Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that is spent,\\ndraw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE.\"\\nHe was referring to the lost African explorer, David Livingstone, whom Stanley eventually tracked down on Lake\\nTanganyika, uttering the immortal words: \"Doctor Livingstone, I presume?\"\\nThat sort of journalism\\'s gone out of fashion. So we can all thank Rolling Stone for opening its pocketbook and telling\\nMichael Hastings to do whatever it took to find General McChrystal. In his brilliant piece, Hastings did that. He also found\\nsomething else: an Afghan policy as fragmented as the team Obama running it.\\nMcChrystal\\'s gone, but not the dysfunction. A blow-up, I presume?

They got into a verbal sparring match at the\\nhearing. I thought holbrooke was polite and responsive.FYIAnd pasted below is the exchange between Corker and Holbrooke:\\nCORKER:\\nMr. Chairman, thank you.\\nI want to thank the ambassador for coming. I know he has a wealth of knowledge and certainly served our country for\\nmany years.\\nA number of us wrote a letter to you asking for this hearing, and my guess is you might have had hearings any way.\\nBut the reason we wrote the letter -- bipartisan letter -- was to provide Congress and the American people with a\\ndefinition of the end state for our civilian operations in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the civilian mission, and a\\ndetailed plan for achieving those objectives, and the very specific, measurable metrics being used to measure progress\\ntowards achieving those objectives.\\nI have to say, I\\'ve been here for an hour and 10 minutes. I have heard nothing -- nothing -- about that. And while I\\nrespect the ambassador, I\\'ve heard a lot of process. I\\'ve heard a lot about meetings. I have no earthly idea -- no earthly\\nidea what our objectives are on the civilian front.\\nAnd I don\\'t know if you have time to begin doing that right now, but this has so far been an incredible waste of time,\\nfrom the standpoint of -- of hearing, though.\\nAnd I have tremendous respect for you, but maybe we have the wrong witness. I hope we\\'ll have maybe Secretary\\nClinton and Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he\\'s supposed to come.\\nBut could you answer the question that was the purpose of these hearings in the first place?\\nHOLBROOKE:\\nI\\'m sorry. You don\\'t feel that I\\'ve told you what our civilian programs are?\\nCORKER:\\nYou\\'ve told me a lot of process. I\\'d like to know a definition of what our end state is for civilian operations, the very\\nquestion we asked when we set this hearing up, is in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the -- for the -- detailed plan for\\nachieving those. I\\'d like to hear you talk about that.\\nI mean, I\\'m glad we have a lot of interagency folks here, but I\\'m not hearing anything that talks about where we\\'re\\ngoing.\\nI\\'d also like to know how the withdrawal date that\\'s been set affects that and how it affects those we\\'re working with\\nin the country.\\nHOLBROOKE:\\nFirst of all, Senator Corker, I believe I have discussed our civilian programs in very considerable detail within the\\nconstraints of time, but we did prepare a report for this committee earlier this year, which was entered into the record\\nand which I will be happy to enter into the record again, if you wish. And you can go through every one of the programs.\\nThe reason I brought my colleagues with me was to show that this was a whole-of-government, an unprecedented\\neffort.\\nNow, on the specifics, since you want specifics, Afghanistan is an agricultural country. It exported agricultural products\\nuntil 1978 and the Soviet invasion. We are trying to rebuild it. This was not being done for the first seven years of this\\nwar.\\nWe have -- your -- your committee has given us a great deal of money for agriculture. And we are spending it wisely in\\na joint AID- USDA effort, which Senator Lugar has particularly been involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs,\\nencouraging alternatives to opium production.\\nHOLBROOKE:\\nSecondly, rule of law. We are spending -- we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create a justice\\nsystem which can cut into the Taliban\\'s propaganda about corruption and lack of a justice system.\\nThird, counter-narcotics. We have ended poppy eradication, a radical change, because all we were doing by\\neradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, was driving farmers, poor farmers, into the hands of the Taliban.\\nFourth, a major program of subnational governance, where we are putting aid directly to the district level.\\nFifth, a major effort in specific areas, some of which were alluded to earlier, such as electricity for Kandahar. Senator\\nKerry asked earlier about Kandahar. One of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as a benefit of the\\ninternational presence.\\nThe whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support General Petraeus\\' counter-\\ninsurgency effort. He and I -- I was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to Kabul. We have worked\\nintimately in an effort to create a joint civilian-military effort. And I am happy to provide you with every detail you wish\\nin private briefings on behalf of me and my team.\\nPoint number two in regard to the end state issue you raised. I want to be clear on the difference between end state\\nand exit strategy.\\nIf we -- this is my personal view, senator -- but if we walk away from Afghanistan, again, as we did 21 years ago, the\\nconsequences will be similarly catastrophic, because of the unique strategic position of Afghanistan and the reaction\\nthat would have in Pakistan, China, India and the country to Afghanistan\\'s west, Iran, as well as the larger region that\\nincludes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and even extending to Western Europe, which is concerned about terrorism from\\nthat region, just as much as we are.\\nSo, I hope that when we talk about end state, we talk about a sustainable end state which involves continued\\nAmerican economic and development assistance, and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and the\\nmilitary. This will not be cheap. But it will be a fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated for\\nthe military campaign.\\nWhen we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say. But it won\\'t be on a single day. It will\\nbe a gradual process. And that is what the review in December and the president\\'s decision-making will focus on.\\nCORKER:\\nIn our foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we\\'ve had some rough times over the last several years -- it\\'s been\\nsomething that we\\'ve been able to address in a bipartisan way. And I think that the issues that you\\'re dealing with, that\\nwe\\'re dealing with in Afghanistan are incredibly tough.\\nI still don\\'t -- I haven\\'t understood what the administration was saying in the beginning. That\\'s not to be critical of\\nthem. I just don\\'t understand. I still don\\'t understand. I\\'ve met with you and your staff over at the State Department. It\\'s\\njust incredibly vague to me.\\nAnd I think what we are doing, we have partners, which include the Pakistanis and everybody around, that they don\\'t\\nknow what we\\'re doing. They don\\'t know when we\\'re leaving. They think we\\'re leaving shortly, I think. We\\'ve just had\\ncolleagues who have come from there.\\nWe\\'ve had a -- we\\'ve got a president there that\\'s having to play both sides, because he wants to survive, because he\\ndoesn\\'t know what our intentions are. The Pakistanis don\\'t know what our intentions are, I don\\'t think. And they\\'re\\nmaking accommodations on both sides.\\nSo, I just have to tell you, I send letters to parents and spouses. And what I feel because of this lack of clarity is that we\\nare in Afghanistan, because we\\'re in Afghanistan, and that we don\\'t have the will to be successful. And we don\\'t have\\nthe will to leave, because of some of the things you just outlined.\\nBut I just don\\'t hear any clarity. And again, I want to support the administration. I want to support you, because that\\'s\\nwhat we need to do as a country, is let the shores (ph) align (ph), let the partisanship.\\nBut I have to tell you, as a person who wants to do that, I still don\\'t understand. OK? And I have average intelligence,\\nso I would ask you to, please -- or maybe let\\'s have some witnesses in here that can shed more light or be more specific.\\nBut I don\\'t understand, and I\\'m very concerned.\\nAnd I think we\\'re sending a lot of mixed signals. And I think there\\'s a lot of dissension. Actually, as I listen to you, even\\nwithin the administration itself, and that has to end.\\nAnd I just ask you, please. You have a lot of experience, help us understand. You haven\\'t done that today. And I would\\nask the chairman to please have some witnesses come in and explain to us what the end state is, what we can envision\\nAfghanistan being whenever this withdrawal does take place, because I still do not understand.\\nWe\\'ve changed it. Now it\\'s sort of a degraded country where they have conflict, but it\\'s not out of control. I mean, the\\nbar continues to change. And I\\'m just concerned as an individual, and yet I want us to be, if we can, all on the same page\\nas much as possible. But I think to do that, this has got to be much clearer than has been outlined.\\nHOLBROOKE:\\nSenator, I\\'m sorry that my answers don\\'t fully satisfy you. But I want to be very clear on this, because I understand\\nyour comments and I respect them.\\nFirst of all, the core question -- the one you are asked by your constituents, and I\\'m asked by everybody -- why are we\\nin Afghanistan? The short, simple answer is 9/11, direct threats to our national security interests, and the fact that while\\nour enemies against our homeland are on the Pakistani side of the border, this is a single struggle. And we have to\\nstrengthen the Afghan government and let -- and teach it to stand on its own feet over time, so that we can move\\nforward, while we do other things that fall outside the scope of this hearing, to dismantle, deter and defeat Al Qaida.\\nNow, if you do not believe that it\\'s a threat to the homeland, then we have an honest difference of opinion. But I think\\nthe Times Square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is.\\nSecondly, on the civilian mission, again, it\\'s in support of a single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And we\\nhave benchmarks, requested and required by the Congress, and submitted to you. And our overarching goal here is\\nalways the same, to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the United States.\\nAnd we believe, all of us -- and there is no division on this in the executive branch -- that the situation we face out\\nthere is a direct threat. We believe that before the Times Square situation occurred, and I don\\'t think anything could\\nhave proved it more vividly.\\nAnd to achieve this, we have to degrade the Taliban as well, because they are part of the enemy\\'s structure -- a\\ndifferent part, but an integral part -- that we face.\\nNow, the Afghan government doesn\\'t yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own. How could they after 30 years\\nof war? And so, the civilian part of it, the things I\\'ve just mentioned to you -- police, government capacity, rule of law,\\nsubnational government, training provincial officials, women\\'s empowerment and a whole series of other major issues --\\nare part of our civilian programs.\\nAnd we\\'re happy to come back up to your office -- we appreciated your visit to us -- and continue this dialogue.\\nOur civilian strategy is designed from keeping Al Qaida at bay, and it\\'s designed to help Afghan institutions establish\\nconditions for stable governance. Our plan has these benchmarks, which have been briefed to you and your colleagues,\\nand we\\'re happy to discuss them in detail at any time.He is calling to complain about Ambassador Holbrooke. He feels that Holbrooke is condescending and not forthcoming,\\nincluding at this week\\'s hearing. He also has broader concerns about the lack of a clear end state and metrics for our\\nAfghan policy, but the main reason he wants to talk to you is about Holbrooke.\\nHolbrooke tried to faithfully answer his questions and frankly Corker was looking for a sound byte and he got one. We\\ncan offer him additional briefings and a readout after your upcoming trip if that would help.\\nYou could use also this opportunity to thank him for sitting down earlier this week on the New START Treaty; to note\\nthat we received and are following up on his July 14 follow-up letter; and that we want to continue working with him to\\nget him to a place where he can support the treaty.FYI — I invited her in since Ricardo reports to her and she and Craig have been doing the cuba engagement.ExactlyTranscript of Malinowski\\'s meeting with Karzai attached.FYI -- Karl and Zakhilwal have gone to Islamabad to try to close the deal.sbwhoeop\\nSaturday, July 17, 2010 9:55 AM\\nH: fyi. circulated in Israeli and US Jewish publications.

He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the Palestinian\\nAuthority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United States\\nwould let such an attack come to fruition.\\n\"I know what America is,\" Netanyahu replied. \"America is\\'a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction.\\nThey won\\'t get in their way.\" He then called former president Bill Clinton \"radically pro-Palestinian,\" and went on to belittle\\nthe Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on to\\npre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vast\\nswaths of land as just that.\\n\"They asked me before the election if rd honor [the Oslo accords],\" Netanyahu said. \"I said I would, but ... I\\'m going to\\ninterpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this gallOping forward to the \\'67 borders. How did\\nwe do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones aresecurity zones; as far as I\\'m\\nconcerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\"\\nSmiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israel\\nalone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. \"They didn\\'t want to give me that\\nletter,\" Netanyahu said, \"so I didn\\'t give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to the\\nPalestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, \\'I\\'m not signing.\\' Only when the letter came, during that meeting, to\\nme and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important?

So it goes.\\nSecretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at Tuesday\\'s Kabul Conference, but\\nAfghan women fear their opinions won\\'t be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will roll\\nback their hard-fought rights.\\nAs Hillary Clinton prepares to attend Tuesday\\'s Kabul Conference, Afghan women are delivering a plain message to\\ngovernment and international officials: Women\\'s voices should be heard.\\n\"We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference, we have not been consulted,\" said Soraya Pakzad, founder\\nof a women\\'s shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat. Her comment came during an unusually heated question-and-\\nanswer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan de\\nMistura marking the end of a two-day women\\'s conference. \"We want to be involved in policy-making. We don\\'t want our\\npresence to be purely symbolic.\"\\n\"Women\\'s rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or\\naccords.\"\\nThe Kabul Conference is, in part, built on symbolism. A follow-up to January\\'s London Conference, the gathering marks\\nthe first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors, a decision that is intended to showcase the transition\\nfrom foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descend\\nupon the Afghan capital, which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seen\\nSunday painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners\\' arrival.\\nDiscussions will center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, and security. The\\ngoal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of the\\ncountry\\'s political and economic direction.\\nAlthough it remains to be seen how quickly the Afghan govemment, long under-resourced and beset by allegations of\\ncorruption, will be able to take the reins from its international donors, there is no question that Afghan ownership is the\\ndirection in which things are moving, on the political, economic, and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feel\\nthe stakes for this week\\'s meeting are so high, particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that might\\nthreaten women\\'s rights.\\n\"After the Kabul Conference, no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations and\\nnegotiations,\" said Orzala Ashraf, an Afghan human rights activist. \"This is very important for us, to get a serious and\\nhonest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not be\\nsilenced.\"\\nAshraf and a number of other women\\'s advocates view Tuesday\\'s talks are their last, best shot at speaking out about their\\nconcerns, with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at the\\ntable. In another show of support, Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet Tuesday\\nmorning with a group of women leaders.\\nRegardless of this high-profile backing, many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything aside\\nfrom more paper and more unkept promises.\\n\"Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments,\" said Selay\\nGhaffar, an Afghan Women\\'s Network board member. \"We want things to change.\"\\nAnd it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul, men or women, are paying attention to yet another gathering to\\ndiscuss their future.\\n\"Women in the provinces don\\'t even know about this,\" said Zainab, a young math teacher from Helmand province. \"I\\nwould say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on.\"\\nOthers say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn\\'t enough to make a difference. And they say\\nthey fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban, particularly in southern Afghanistan.\\n\"This is very dangerous,\" said Shahida Hussain, a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a community\\norganizer during the Taliban years. \"We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fear\\nwar again.\"\\nWomen leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters, but only if they respect women\\'s\\nconstitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law.\\n\"Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan,\" said the\\nwomen in a statement at the end of their meeting. \"Women\\'s rights and achievements should not be compromised in any\\npeace negotiations or accords.\"\\nIn the meantime, women continue to fight for a voice as Tuesday approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference calls,\\nembassy meetings, and lunchtime gatherings, two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak.\\nAnd in a small victory for women, international officials agreed with Pakzad\\'s assessment before pledging that women\\nwould be more involved going forward.\\n\"I agree, you were not consulted,\" said da Mistura, appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister, who only a few\\nmoments earlier had said that women\\'s views had and would be included. \"As usual, we have been paying lip service to\\nyou and we are all at fault for that.\"\\nGayle Tzemach Lemmon covered presidential politics as a producer at ABC News in Washington.

Doubt I made a copy but I may have cause he\\'d asked\\nfor a tour. Let me check tomorrow.WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan\\'s Taliban with new financial\\nsanctions Thursday in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile with\\ninsurgents.\\nThe action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants\\' assets, ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. It\\nfollows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week, and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus, the top\\nmilitary commander in Afghanistan, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for\\nsanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan.\\nTaken together, the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. member\\ncountries, putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants.\\nThree financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions, including a key member of the Haqqani network, which,directs\\noperations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctioned\\nThursday was Nasiruddin Haqqani, an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leads\\nthe group with his father, Jalaluddin.\\nOthers sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai, the head of the Taliban\\'s financial commission and Amir Abdullah, the\\nformer treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders as\\nterrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations, said Adam J. Szubin, director of\\nTreasury\\'s Office of Foreign Assets Control. \"We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financial\\nnetworks of terrorist groups in support of the president\\'s goal of a stable Afghanistan,\" he said.\\nAccording to officials, lshakzai is the head of the Taliban\\'s financial commission, has collected money for suicide attacks\\nin Kandahar, Afghanistan, and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. He has served as a\\nmain financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled to\\nKuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings and\\ncommunications with key leaders. Nasiruddin Haqqani has collected funds for the Haqqani group, including from al-\\nQaida. Last week, Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Afghanistan, urged officials to add commanders\\nfrom the Haqqani network to the terrorist list. At the time, administration officials said a review was under way, largely\\naccelerated after the May 1 failed Times Square bombing. The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incident,\\nPakistani-born American Faisal Shahzad, said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs, then returned to the\\nU.S. to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U.S. forces overseas.Latest update:\\nSullivan, Jacob J <SullivanJJ@state.gov>\\nSunday, May 16, 2010 10:30 PM\\nH\\nMills, Cheryl D\\nIranH: I\\'m sure you are preoccupied with the adventures of Lula, et al. Nonetheless, the article below, just posted by the NY\\nReview, soon to be published, is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact. It\\'s worth reading, not least for Frank\\nLuntz\\'s poll numbers. The hysterical tone of much of the Israeli leadership and US Jewish community is partly rooted in\\nthis long-term and profound development. Sid\\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/failure-american-jewish-establishment/\\nThe Failure of the American Jewish Establishment\\nJune 10, 2010\\nby Peter Beinart\\nE-mail Single Page Share More by Peter Beinart\\nanjamin Netanyahu; drawing by John Springs\\nIn 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish\\ncollege students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced the\\nmost damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen.\\nThe philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn\\'t. \"Six\\ntimes we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,\" he\\nreported. \"Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word\\n\\'they\\' rather than\\'us` to describe the situation.\"\\nThat Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of\\nSteven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and An Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that \"non-Orthodox\\nyounger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,\" with many professing \"a near-total\\nabsence of positive feelings.\" In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university\\nin America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.\\nLuntz\\'s task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students\\' views of Israel, he hit up against some\\nfirm beliefs. First, \"they reserve the right to question the Israeli position.\" These young Jews, Luntz explained, \"resist\\nanything they see as \\'group think.\" They want an \"open and frank\" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, \"young\\nJews desperately want peace.\" When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled \"Proof that\\nIsrael Wants Peace,\" and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, \"some\\nempathize with the plight of the Palestinians.\" When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful,\\nseveral focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.\\nMost of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of\\nAmerican Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human\\nrights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.\\nThe only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and\\ncapable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz did\\nnot grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment\\nhas been working against for most of their lives.\\nAmong American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted to\\nthe State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted to\\nhuman rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the younger\\ngenerations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal.\\nOne reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively opposed—a\\nZionism that challenges Israel\\'s behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For several\\ndecades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism\\'s door, and now, to their\\nhorror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.\\nMorally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents\\nof Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-\\ndominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular\\nAmerican Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American Jews\\ncan help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntz\\'s\\nstudents wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel\\'s current government, by no longer averting our eyes.\\nSince the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew\\nUniversity political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, \"After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist\\nnarrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions.\" One version, \"founded on a long memory of\\npersecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in\\nJewish power and solidarity.\" Another, \"nourished by secularized Versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment\\nidea of progress,\" articulates \"a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values.\"\\nEvery country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth.\\nAs Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,\\nparticularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.\\nYou can see this spirit in \"new historians\" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist\\npast and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the\\nhuman rights guarantees in Israel\\'s \"Basic Laws.\" You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak\\'s apparent\\nwillingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.\\nBut in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To\\nunderstand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s government, it\\'s worth\\nconsidering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically\\ncleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. \"We\\'ll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here\\nand remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,\" he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into\\nNetanyahu\\'s Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu\\'s special emissary for overseas \"campus\\nengagement.\" In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government\\'s\\nbehalf. The group that organized his tour was called \"Caravan for Democracy.\"\\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam\\'s views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane\\'s now\\nbanned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman\\'s position might be\\ncalled \"pre-expulsion.\" He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won\\'t swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish\\nstate. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel\\'s 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the\\nKnesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail\\nArabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from\\nother countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.\\nYou don\\'t have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman\\'s current views and his former ones. The more\\nyou strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of\\nexpulsion becomes. Lieberman\\'s American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What they\\nusually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel\\'s border so that a large chunk of Israeli\\nArabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.\\nLieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu\\'s first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,\\nNetanyahu\\'s own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé\\'s. In his 1993 book, A Place among the\\nNations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. In\\nfact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank,\\nhe has declared, would be a \"ghetto-state\" with \"Auschwitz borders.\" And the effort \"to gouge Judea and Samaria [the\\nWest Bank] out of Israel\" resembles Hitler\\'s bid to wrench the German-speaking \"Sudeten district\" from Czechoslovakia in\\n1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenching\\nconcessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of the\\nJewish state.\\nOn the left of Netanyahu\\'s coalition sits Ehud Barak\\'s emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it may\\nhave is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party\\nrepresenting Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its Ashkenazi ultra-\\nOrthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious\\nto find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidies\\nit is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And they\\nhave done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism\\'s profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia\\nYosef, Shas\\'s immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs \"vipers,\" \"snakes,\" and \"ants.\" In 2005, after Prime\\nMinister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that \"God strike him down.\" The\\nofficial Shas newspaper recently called President Obama \"an Islamic extremist.\"\\nHebrew University Professor Ze\\'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.\\nCommenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, \"The last time politicians\\nholding views similar to theirs were in power in post–World War II Western Europe was in Franco\\'s Spain.\" With their\\nblessing, \"a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order.\"\\nSternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.\\nIsraeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli\\nsociety: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical and\\nmore entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to\\nanti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent\\nof recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst among\\nIsrael\\'s young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll found that 56\\npercent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students—\\nwould deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey \"a huge\\nwarning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.\"\\nYou might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel\\'s government, would occasion\\nsubstantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In\\nIsrael itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.\\n(Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an \"apartheid state\" if it\\ncontinues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of\\nthe occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that \"Israel has not been democratic for\\nsome time now.\") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents\\' Conference patrol public discourse,\\nscolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn\\nfor peace.\\nThe result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.\\nOn its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel\\'s commitment to \"free speech and minority rights.\" The Conference of Presidents\\ndeclares that \"Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,\\nsecurity and peace.\" These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu\\'s coalition, that Israeli Arabs don\\'t deserve\\nfull citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don\\'t deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything\\nany Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very\\nliberal values they profess to admire.\\nAfter Israel\\'s elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents\\'\\nConference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman\\'s agenda was \"far more moderate than the media has presented it.\"\\nInsisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-\\nDefamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that \"He\\'s not saying expel them. He\\'s not saying punish them.\"\\n(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day\\nevidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American Jewish\\nCommittee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman\\'s proposed loyalty oath would \"chill Israel\\'s democratic political debate.\"\\nBut the Forward summed up the overall response of America\\'s communal Jewish leadership in its headline \"Jewish\\nLeaders Largely Silent on Lieberman\\'s Role in Government.\"\\nNot only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries to\\nprevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a\\ncampaign to discredit the world\\'s most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty\\nInternational report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians \"bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic.\" The Conference\\nof Presidents has announced that \"biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and]\\nSave the Children.\" Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch \"has repeatedly\\ndemonstrated its anti-Israel bias.\" When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary\\nRobinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she had\\npresided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference report\\nimplicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)\\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents\\'\\nConference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israel\\'s neighbors—they\\nleave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply\\ndefending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist\\nvisions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an \"animus toward Israel,\" an\\nalliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like\\nB\\'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human\\nRights, have been at least as critical of Israel\\'s actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty\\nInternational and Human Rights Watch.\\nAll of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel\\'s overseas human rights critics\\nare motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel\\'s domestic human rights critics?\\nThe implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don\\'t generally say\\nthat, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel\\'s vice prime minister, Moshe Ya\\'alon,\\ncalled the anti-occupation group Peace Now a \"virus.\" This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli\\nhuman rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel\\'s Gaza war. A\\nKnesset member from Netanyahu\\'s Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supports\\nsome of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman\\'s party launched an investigation aimed at\\ncurbing foreign funding of Israeli NG0s.\\nTo their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own\\nwork. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel\\'s government\\nis motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make\\nthe same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.\\nIn the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equal\\ncitizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generational\\nreasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they are\\nunmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders;\\nand they are secular. They don\\'t want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want them\\nto be agents of the Israeli right.\\nThese American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up to\\nthe Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, when\\nmuch of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity, often in\\nconjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life. These Jews\\nembraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982 Lebanon war,\\nbefore the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped by the culture,\\npolitics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the settlers, and Shas,\\nAmerican Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally cohesive, more\\ninnocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.\\nBut these secular Zionists aren\\'t reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on\\nIsrael\\'s border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they\\nhave grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than\\ntheir parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption\\nbecause its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents\\' liberalism, they cannot embrace their\\nuncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment\\nis fake.\\nTo sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America\\'s Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to\\nreplenish their ranks. They will need to find young American. Jews who have come of age during the West Bank\\noccupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the\\nOrthodox world.\\nBecause they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of the\\nAmerican Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews make\\nup only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of eighteen and\\ntwenty-four. For America\\'s Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In their yeshivas\\nthey learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after high school, and\\noften know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while only 16 percent of\\nnon-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel \"very close to Israel,\" among the Orthodox the figure is 79 percent. As\\nsecular Jews drift away from America\\'s Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely step into the breach. The\\nOrthodox \"are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns,\" explains Samuel Heilman, a sociologist at the City University\\nof New York. \"They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they now control the lights.\"\\nBut it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones—\\nthat gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-\\nOrthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the\\nOrthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University\\'s Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he\\nfound Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more tellingly,\\nReform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had been ill-\\nserved by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the enemy, and to\\ndeny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.\\nOrthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in\\nthe American Jewish world. (I\\'m biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,\\nthe growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America\\'s Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-democratic\\nveneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America\\'s major Jewish organizations sponsored a large Israel\\nsolidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the\\nestimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul\\nWolfowitz told the rally that \"innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well,\" he was booed.\\nAmerica\\'s Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an\\nAmerican Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish\\npopulation that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up\\namong the booers as among Luntz\\'s focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.\\nIn 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of\\nhouses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and\\npolitician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the\\nruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.\\nIn that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he\\nwatched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on\\nmalnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli\\nhuman rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—it\\'s unpleasant.\\nRationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster\\nZionism among America\\'s young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word \"Arabs, not Palestinians,\" since\\n\"the term `Palestinians\\' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,\" while \"Arab\\' says wealth, oil\\nand Islam.\"\\nOf course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are\\nmorally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies\\neverything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents\\' Conference should ask themselves what Israel\\'s leaders would have\\nto do or say to make them scream \"no.\" After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American universities;\\nsettlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs\\nbarred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?\\nWhat infuriated critics about Lapid\\'s comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the\\nmemory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do.\\n•\\nBut at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust\\nanalogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about\\nthemselves. Many of Israel\\'s founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treated\\nthe non-Jews living under their dominion. \"For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,\" Knesset\\nmember Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, \"and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews live\\nwith a minority.\"\\nBut the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the\\nopposite: since Jews are history\\'s permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a\\nluxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his\\nremarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, \"Victimhood sets you free.\"\\nThis obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America\\'s secular Jewish young. It simply\\nbears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel\\'s. Yes, Israel faces threats from Hezbollah\\nand Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you possess\\ndozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the\\ndilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish\\nvictimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most of\\ntoday\\'s young American Jews as farce.\\nBut there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel\\'s\\nIndependence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state \"will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and\\npeace taught by the Hebrew prophets,\" and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and others\\nto The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin\\'s visit to the United States after his party\\'s\\nmilitias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewish\\nfortunes have radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use of\\nJewish power.\\nFor several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood\\nof Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,\\nfrom which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a\\npermit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into\\nthe thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was the\\nface of Zionism shown to America\\'s Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz\\'s focus group had been told that their\\ngeneration faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish state\\non earth?\\n\"Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it,\" writes Avraham Burg. \"I\\nwas very comfortable there.\" I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral\\nabdication. Let\\'s hope that Luntz\\'s students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an\\nuncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be. Let\\'s hope\\nthey care enough to try.\\n—May 12, 2010 .\\nPeter Beinart is Associate Professor of Journalism and Political Science at the City University of New York, a Senior\\nFellow at the New America Foundation, and Senior Political Writer for The Daily Beast.

The 81-year-\\nold scholar added:\\nI can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he\\nwas receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was\\nthat the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose\\nevery other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an\\ninvitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past\\nbut not this time.\\nMr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the\\nPalestinian university in Ramallah.\\nThe renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and\\nhas criticized Israel\\'s occupation of Palestinian territory many times.\\nIn an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, \"I objected to the\\nfounding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don\\'t think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object\\nto the United States as a Christian state.\" When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,\\n\"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew,\" he replied:\\nIt is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It\\'s grotesque.

With 14 years at the helm of the small but\\ninfluential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in\\nour region.\\nOn behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with\\nfar-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and\\nby becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds.\\nShe became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds\\nfrom the sale of Hannarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit\\norganization.\\nThe new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae,\\nan organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville\\nRehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and people\\nwith disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.\\nMs. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and\\nending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. \"I realized the\\nimpact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but it\\'s a very focused\\nfoundation,\" she said.\\nOver the past 14 years, FISA\\'s endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million\\nhas been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations.\\nA roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with\\ndisabilities in all aspects of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national\\nmodels.\\nWomen with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings.\\nStandard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical\\nstaff often struggle to accommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed money\\nfor the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, one of the first\\nsuch clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to healthcare\\nfor people with disabilities.\\nLikewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at\\nAchieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for\\nPatients with Special Needs at Pitt\\'s School of Dental Medicine.\\nFISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more\\naccessible and helping places of worship more welcoming\\n\"Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn\\'t have the\\nissues we have,\" said Kim Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based\\nin Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004.\\nNancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped\\nsolve are ones that people have been working on for years.\\n\"People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders\\ntogether to get to the solutions,\" said Ms. Murray.\\n\"I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders,\\nleading by example on the value of true collaboration,\" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA\\nand former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee.\\n\"With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA\\'s role, it is always about unmet needs in the\\ncommunity and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner,\\nand in everyone who has the privilege of working with her.\"\\nMs. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order\\n\"were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds.\"\\n\"I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven\\'t learned\\nsomething, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else\\'s\\nideas and efforts.\"\\nIn her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to \"give back to the community in new ways,\" she said. A\\nnew frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. \"We\\nhave to keep the fire burning.\"\\nOn May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundation\\'s program\\ndirector for six years, was promoted to executive director.\\n\"We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney\\'s visionary leadership and guide the\\nfoundation into the next decade,\" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. \"We know\\nthat we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing the\\npopulations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community.\"FYI\\nGeorge Richert\\nMay 25, 2010 6:00 p.m.\\nA new Buffalo Bill is catching the world\\'s attention.\\nOn the practice field Tuesday afternoon, he was just another Bill, a rookie no less, but he\\'s\\ncatching a lot of attention in his family\\'s homeland.\\nIn China this week, during a speech to dignitaries at the USA Pavilion, Secretary of State Hillary\\nClinton said this:\\n\"From Yo-Yo Ma to I.M.

And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the\\nfirst Chinese-American to play in the NFL,\" said Clinton.\\nBuffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, \"It felt good. She\\'s a very important person, and so\\nfor someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good.\"\\nWang didn\\'t know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai.

B6HRC: Below is an oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow\\'s Outlook.\\nUnfortunately, they give it a horrible title, but I think the piece turned out alright.\\nBest, Sandy\\nBy Samuel R. Berger\\nSamuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to\\nPresident Clinton from 1997 to 2001.\\nPresident Obama\\'s National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but\\nunavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and\\na reordering of political power abroad?\\nFor some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The\\nSeptember 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf\\nunderscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America\\'s\\nmilitary supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of\\npowerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs\\nand benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without\\nothers, nor should we bear the burden alone.\\nEnter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become\\nlaborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.\\n(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don\\'t step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to\\nme and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs\\nadministration decision makers up and down the line. It\\'s not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the\\npresident\\'s principles and priorities.\\nIn Obama\\'s case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with\\npast strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear\\nproliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.\\nOne such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal\\nburden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic\\nand technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point\\nspeech last weekend. \"At no time in human history,\" he said, \"has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained\\nits military and political primacy.\"\\nAnother fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the\\npresident has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a\\nglobal summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort\\nstarted in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.\\nOn terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have\\ndeployed all of America\\'s tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and\\nvigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global\\nWar on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. \"This is not a global war against a tactic\\n- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,\" the new strategy says. \"We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its\\nterrorist affiliates.\"\\nThis sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the\\nbroader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and\\nturn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein\\'s Iraq.\\nIn perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a\\nless provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the\\nrationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the\\nprinciples that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the\\ncosts and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to\\nact unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often\\ndescribed as \"together where possible, alone where necessary.\"\\nPresident Obama\\'s critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The\\nPresident sets forth his rationale: \"to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international\\ncommunity\\'s support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate\\nto the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.\"\\nIn the case of Iran, Washington\\'s outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran\\'s compliance. But attempts to engage have\\nhelped ensure that the world\\'s attention is focused on Iran\\'s intransigence rather than Washington\\'s refusal to\\nnegotiate.\\nWithout a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration\\'s stated goal of\\ndoubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and\\nColombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.\\nSixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie\\nahead.\\nIn the strategy\\'s conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to\\nrestore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite\\nthe intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported\\nthe containment of communism.\\nIn that same spirit, the administration\\'s framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our\\ndifferences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or\\nthe costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals\\nspelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding\\nin Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of\\nenlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.See below from arturo.Things aren\\'t as bad as they seem.\\nIt took a little bit to figure out, but turns out that O\\'Reilly didn\\'t have a new show last night - in its place they re-aired the\\nshow from May 17th, the original night Posner got beat up.

White House spokesman Bill Burton said in\\nadvance of Netanyahu\\'s decision that the White House was currently \"to understand the circumstances surrounding this\\ntragedy.\"He called for you. Wants to discuss situation in israel and trip cancellation. Says he\\'s flexible time wise.\\nPhil gordon and jeff feltman obviously following situation. We don\\'t have a formal talking points yet.First observation: Bibi\\'s Entebbe in reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu, 100 years old, secretary to Jabotinsky, and\\ndenounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.\\nBenzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks\\nhis father\\'s approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion\\'s most recent scathing undermining of his son\\nBibi and Bibi\\'s tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on Entebbe,\\nexcept that there are no hostages, no guns, it\\'s not in Africa, and it\\'s a fiasco; otherwise, it\\'s Entebbe. (Then, there\\'s Ehud\\nBarak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielberg\\'s film, Munich.\\nUltimately, it didn\\'t work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries, which appear to have escaped\\nthe participants.)\\nFurther observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama administration gave a wink or nod as the\\nBush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.\\nFurther: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from the\\nanalogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did the\\nIsraelis not hear Petraeus\\'s testimony?\\nFurther: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peace\\nprocess, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibi\\'s scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under any\\ncircumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president.

When asked if his son really changed his position concerning a Palestinian state,\\nthe 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine)\\n\"He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I\\nheard from him. I didn\\'t propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not\\none of them.\"\\nWhen asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated:\\nHerzl and Nordau (fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is\\nJewish land and not a land for the Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place\\nhere for the Arabs. They will never agree to the conditions.\\nPublished: 04/18/10, 9:03 AM / Last Update: 04/18/10, 9:21 AM\\nNetanyahu Visits Grave of Brother Who Fell in\\nEntebbe Rescue\\nby Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu\\nFollow Israel news on 4nd\\nOn Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring\\nrescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976.\\nHe and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance Day\\nfor Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery Sunday\\nnight and Monday.\\nThe Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF carved\\ninto the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver.

Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948 War for Independence, when\\nseven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the Holocaust ended.\\nOn Monday morning, a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). (IsraelNationalNews.com)Netanyahu pleased: I didn\\'t capitulate\\nBen Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]\\nIn the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime Minister\\nBinyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.\\nNetanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel between\\nhim and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make concessions on our red\\nlines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn\\'t want to go, said Netanyahu, according to people who\\nheard him speak.\\nNetanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to expire in\\nSeptember. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the administration that the\\nIsraeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories, and the Americans will \"make\\nsure\" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take \"aggressive\" action and construction\\nwill be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs.\\nThe Prime Minister \\'s Bureau vigorously denied the above report. \"The statements attributed to the prime minister are\\nincorrect,\" said a spokesman in the Prime Minister\\'s Bureau. \"They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The reason is\\nsimple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the commitment by President\\nObama and the administration to Israel\\'s security and their efforts to renew the peace process in our region.\"\\nEli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week might\\nattest to a radical change in the White House\\'s attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the planned meeting\\nas \"the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama administration in the past number of\\nweeks.\" The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave crisis that erupted some two months ago\\nbetween the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and particularly over the continued\\nconstruction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that was received as if Israel was \"no longer an absolute\\nally of the United States.\"\\nThat crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire among\\nmembers of the Obama administration to rectib) the situation. Another reason for the administration\\'s desire to end the crisis\\nis the fear offailure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. \"The Democratic Party\\'s coffers are empty.\\nMany Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to continue, they\\nwould be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections,\" said one source in Washington.\\nThe prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two months\\nago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture taken together\\nand to give statements to the media.\\nThat said, sources in Washington noted that \"Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap once\\nagain. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very difficult\\nquestions, like \\'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.\\'\"\\nNetanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel\\'s acceptance\\ninto the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his movement through\\nthe city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.Draft statement for use in the Council Chamber, May 31, 2010\\nThank you, Mr. President.

Judis\\n• August 12, 2010 I 12:00 am\\nOn April 14, 2009, as Barack Obama\\'s standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators were\\namassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the\\n\"five pillars\" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama\\'s program that\\nwould evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt\\'s Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt\\'s New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson\\'s\\nGreat Society.\\nObama\\'s contribution was to be the New Foundation. \"We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—a\\nfoundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest,\" he declared. Obama\\nwould repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obama\\'s private\\nWhite House dinner with presidential historians that June, the historians were no more impressed than the public with\\nthe New Foundation as a slogan. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to work,\" Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said it\\nsounded \"like a woman\\'s girdle.\"\\nOne of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a\\nDemocratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, \"Tonight, I want to\\nexamine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a\\nprosperous world.\" Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he asked\\nmembers of Congress to join him \"in building that new foundation.\" Like Obama\\'s effort, the phrase inspired, at most, a\\nfew underwear jokes and was then forgotten.\\nObama\\'s evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over\\nhis presidency. Of course, Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during his\\nentire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspired\\ncampaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and\\ninitially stirred hopes of a \"transformational\" presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect with\\nlarge parts of the electorate.\\nTo be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both men\\ncontended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters\\' approval of a president and his\\nparty tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful\\nbusiness lobby, and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency.\\nYet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been an\\ninability to develop a politics that resonates with the public.\\nIn the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed from\\nyeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, in\\nBill Clinton\\'s words, \"those who work hard and play by the rules.\" They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric\\nthat goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below\\n(impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street\\nlobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing.\\nPoliticians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, who found a way of using populism\\'s appeal during downturns\\nhave enjoyed success, while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one,\\nyou don\\'t develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That\\'s\\nwhat Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late \\'70s. And that\\'s what has happened in the last 20 months of the\\nGreat Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads.\\nObama took office with widespread popular support, even among Republicans, and some of his first efforts, including the\\n$800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of\\n2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and\\nVirginia. By January 2010, it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown\\'s astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in\\nMassachusetts.\\nIn the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama\\'s dogged pursuit of health care reform\\nwhile the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. What\\ndoomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In an\\natmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms.\\nAs Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparent\\nthat financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played a\\nvery large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the \"money\\nchangers,\" as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter\\'s infamous \"malaise\"\\nspeech, put the blame on the public as a whole. \"Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and\\nirresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new\\nage,\" he declared.\\nOver the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times calling\\nthe bonuses they gave themselves \"shameful\" and an \"outrage\"—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the\\nbankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesman\\nRobert Gibbs said, \"emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street.\" And, in his\\nGeorgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, \"was caused by\\na perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main\\nStreet.\"\\nObama\\'s policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bank\\nand insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowing\\nbankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, he\\nwould fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—in\\nsharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or\\neven to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009, Obama\\nand his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.)\\nObama\\'s appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed Timothy\\nGeithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president of\\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie\\nDimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go\\nunder, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditors\\nwith government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic\\nSenator Byron Dorgan told me, \"Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts, and the\\nadministration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street.\"\\nBy the spring, Obama\\'s apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newly\\nformed Tea Party movement, Beck and Fox News, and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but, in a less\\nextreme form, the general public shared their anger. In an early April New York Times/CBS News poll, the public\\ndisapproved of Obama\\'s aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll, public approval of Obama\\'s\\nhandling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama\\'s economic\\npolicies to his handling of the financial crisis.\\nCongressman Barney Frank, who defends Obama\\'s policies, acknowledges that the president\\'s political difficulties began\\nwith the revelation that MG, which had received $170 billion from the government, had paid out $165 billion in bonuses\\nto the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were no\\nlegal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris\\nDodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) \"The pitchforks were out. It added injury to\\ninjury,\" Frank says. That\\'s when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. According to a Rasmussen poll, 24 percent had a\\nfavorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one.\\nThe public\\'s view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout, the stimulus, and health\\ncare reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was \"where\\'s my bailout?\" (Obama himself\\nacknowledged that it was \"one of the most frequent questions\" he was asked in letters.) The auto program became a\\nbailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailout\\nfor the uninsured—or \"reparations,\" as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, \"hardworking\\ncitizens were getting sick of being played for chumps\" by \"moochers, big and small, corporate and individual, trampling\\nover themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts.\" Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayed\\nas aiding \"the moochers,\" but not the \"hardworking citizens.\" In American politics, that\\'s a recipe for political disaster.\\nSome in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration\\'s economic efforts were\\nbeing defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the White\\nHouse began calling themselves the \"pitchfork gang,\" but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get tough\\non Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head Larry\\nSummers, who were worried about upsetting business confidence. \"There was a continual tension in the White House,\"\\nsays a person who was privy to the discussions. \"One week, we would be very hot, and then, the next week, we would dial it\\nback.\"\\nBy early January of this year, Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. According to a CNN poll, 60 percent\\nof Americans thought Obama \"had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions\"\\nthan to the \"problems faced by middle class Americans.\" Only 28 percent, barely more than a quarter, thought he had paid\\nmore attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls, the White House temporarily embraced\\na populist approach. On January 14, Obama called the bank bonuses \"obscene\" and said, \"we want our money back.\" In a\\nJanuary 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown), Obama used the\\nword \"fighting\" 13 times and \"fight\" nine times. \"I will not stop fighting for you,\" he declared.\\nBut, faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street, Obama once again turned conciliatory. On February io,\\nhe said that he didn\\'t \"begrudge\" the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEO\\nLloyd Blankfein. \"I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen.\"\\nObama\\'s reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill, or even no bill at all,\\nbut, on April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week, an\\nemboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their \"failure of responsibility.\" As a result of the\\nindictment and Obama\\'s rediscovery of his anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate\\nRepublicans broke with the party\\'s leadership, and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much stronger\\nbill than the Democrats had ever expected.\\nBut Obama\\'s embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizon\\'s\\nIvan Seidenberg, the head of the Business Roundtable, criticized Obama for being anti-business in June, the president\\ndispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama has\\nsaid enough to anger the CEOs, but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them.\\nObama\\'s unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, along with his delayed and muddled response to\\nthe BP disaster in the Gulf, has eroded the public\\'s confidence in his leadership. In Pew\\'s midyear report card on Obama\\'s\\nimage, the greatest drop from February 2009 to this June was in the perception of Obama as a \"strong leader.\" Voters will\\nsometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or Reagan, whom they regard as \"strong,\"\\nbut not from politicians like Jimmy Carter, whom they regard as weak.\\nWhat of the other factors behind Obama\\'s political difficulties? There is no doubt that, if the economy were growing faster,\\nand if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent, Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a\\nNovember rout. But, unfortunately, the economy\\'s sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the White\\nHouse\\'s weak political performance.\\nIn January, when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose, Christina Romer, the head of the Council of\\nEconomic Advisors, proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, the chairman of the House Budget Committee,\\ntold The Fiscal Times that Obama\\'s Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administration\\nfinally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulate\\nsaving than consumption—and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama\\'s first term.\\nIn the stimulus\\'s first year, the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated for\\ninfrastructure spending.\\nProminent economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, made the case that a much larger stimulus was\\nnecessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment, and that, if a modest stimulus failed to reduce\\nunemployment, Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additional\\nKeynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear to have\\nunderestimated the depth of the Great Recession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political clout\\nto get more from Congress.\\nBut the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was);\\nframed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs,\\nand Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made\\nthis sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated.\\nSo it\\'s not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasn\\'t\\nitself a result of political timidity.\\nThe president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he\\nthought it could accomplish. Obama\\'s New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, to\\nthe dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From then\\nto Labor Day, he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time when\\nthe right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn\\'t just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; he\\ndidn\\'t really try.\\nContrast Obama\\'s attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced with\\nsteadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November, Reagan and his\\npolitical staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling for\\nvoters to \"stay the course\" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. \"We are clearing away\\nthe economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps,\" Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing \"the blame\\ngame,\" but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White House for ten months, worked. The Republicans were\\npredicted to lose as many as 50 House seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate.\\nSome commentators have noted Reagan\\'s popularity was even lower than Obama\\'s. But, on key economic questions, he\\ndid much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience with\\nReagan\\'s program. According to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressed\\nconfidence that Reagan\\'s program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at a\\npostwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagan\\'s economic\\nprogram would eventually help the country. That\\'s a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could command\\nthose numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop a\\nnarrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats.\\nWhy has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit is\\nclearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he was\\nschooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings\\nof the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarial\\ntactics behind.\\nThe young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very different\\nstyle of politics. Obama\\'s principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring\\nvideotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago\\nDemocrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics a\\nhigher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city\\'s Democratic machine. He was also a post-\\nracial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter,\\nwho partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace\\'s angry racial populism.)\\nObama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself.\\nHe is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to \"end the political strategy that has been based on division,\" to\\n\"turn the page\" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aides\\njokingly referred to him as the \"black Jesus.\" While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to actively\\nfoment it. \"In a time of crisis, we can\\'t afford to govern out of anger,\" he declared in February 2009. During his campaign\\nand his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his\\nlegislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare.\\nHis advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of\\n\"hope\" and \"change\" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In a\\nmeeting with congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accorded\\nequal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the \"cynical politics in Washington.\" Within the White\\nHouse, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama \"brand.\" Organizing for America, the administration\\'s campaign\\norganization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing parties\\nacross the country to celebrate Obama\\'s forty-ninth birthday.\\nThese efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama\\'s image as an\\niconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicians\\nhave projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. He has remained \"the other\" that he\\naspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined.\\nThe White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts\\nin The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall\\nStreet on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year,\\nAlter writes, \"Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn\\'t be confronted\\nwhile they remained in peril.\" Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, making\\nit far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery\\nand Democrats\\' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy.\\nPopulism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middle\\nclass, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populist\\nObama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and\\nprobably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the American\\npolitical psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover or Carter—or, more recently,\\npresidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls.\\nIf Obama\\'s politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a Republican president\\nin 2012, then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It\\'s unlikely that a new Republican president and\\nCongress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public funds\\nand deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or\\nhostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection\\nAgency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to come\\nin; and that\\'s where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short.\\nJohn B.

Sid\\nOr I could send the endless pieces on Obama and his troubles or Haaretz on the new negotiations. I\\'ll skip the torrent of\\nObama pieces (see Politico lead piece today, if you want to catch the full updraft of new conventional wisdom), but include\\nHaaretz below from its editorial editor and Teddy Kollek\\'s former spokesman:\\n• Home\\n• Print Edition\\n• News\\n• Published 01:58 23.08.10\\n• Latest update 01:58 23.08.10\\nith a victory like this..\\nThe direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians\\nhave preconditions - dictated by Israel.\\nBy At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peace\\nTwo years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14\\ncOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held \"without\\npreconditions,\" and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.\\nBut unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to\\nenter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40\\npoints), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he\\nhad decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.\\nThe illuminating movie \"Friendship Games,\" to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel (directed by Ram Levy, along\\nwith Ibtisam IVIara\\'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz,\\nan American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to\\nthe Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join\\nthe other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fats(); to don the shirts of the Palestinian\\nteam. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity..\\nThe direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the\\nconditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East\\nJerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where\\ntalks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the\\nAnnapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.\\nThe head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging\\nAbbas to Washington. Barack °barna decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding\\nbuilding in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on\\nthe basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians.\\nIt\\'s time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!\\nIf Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then\\nhe can really chalk up another victory. But Israel\\'s success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the\\ntournament, is not measured by the terms \"victory\" or \"defeat.\" What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it\\nwas won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process\\nwith the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas\\' standing and leads nowhere?\\nWhat have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel\\'s\\napproach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there\\'s no point in bothering so many VIPs with\\nanother unnecessary summit. Let\\'s assume that we\\'ll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist\\nAbbas\\' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple\\nMount. How many hours would such an agreement last?\\nAll we need is a few more \"victories\" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, \"without preconditions,\" and\\nwe\\'ll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state\\n(the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I\\'m concerned).\\nWhat will we do if Abbas announces that he\\'s had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he\\'s decided\\nthe time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian\\npresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?\\nThis story is lojr:\\n• kiva Eldar\\nAkiva Eldar is the chief political columnist and an editorial writer for Haaretz.

Sid\\n/of Rage\\n1:1\\nDays of Rage -- The\\nNoxious\\nTransformation of\\nthe Conservative\\nMovement into a\\nRabid Fringe\\nBy Max Blumenthal, Nation Books\\nPosted on August 10, 2010, Printed on\\nAugust 17, 2010\\nhttp://www.alternet.orgistory/147784/\\nEditor\\'s Note: The following is\\nthe new epilogue from Max\\nBlumenthal\\'s book, Republic\\nGomorrah, now out in paperback\\n(Basic/Nation Books, 2009).\\n\"He will tell you\\nthat he wants a\\nstrong authority to\\ntake from him the\\ncrushing\\nresponsibility of\\nthinking for\\nhimself Since the\\nRepublic is weak,\\nhe is led to break\\nthe law out of love\\nfor obedience. But\\nis it really strong\\nauthority that he\\nwishes? In reality\\nhe demands\\nrigorous order for\\nothers, and for\\nhimself disorder\\nwithout\\nresponsibility.\" --\\nJean-Paul Sartre,\\n\"Anti-Semite and\\nJew\"\\nI am not sure when I first detected\\nthe noxious fumes that would\\nenvelop the conservative\\nmovement in the Obama era. It\\nmight have been early on, in\\nApril 2009, when I visited a\\nseries of gun shows in rural\\nCalifornia and Nevada. Perusing\\ntables piled high with high-\\ncaliber semi-automatic weapons\\nand chatting with anyone in my\\nvicinity, I heard urgent warnings\\nof mass roundups, concentration\\ncamps, and a socialist\\ngovernment in Washington.\\n\"These people that are purchasing\\nthese guns are people that are\\nworried about what\\'s going on in\\nthis country,\" a gun dealer told\\nme outside a show in Reno.\\n\"Good luck Obama,\" a young gun\\nenthusiast remarked to me. \"We\\noutnumber him 100 to 1.\" At this\\ntime, the Tea Party movement\\nhad not even registered on the\\nnational media\\'s radar.\\nIn September 2009, I led a panel\\ndiscussion about this book inside\\nan auditorium filled with nearly\\n100 students and faculty at the\\nUniversity of California-\\nRiverside. Beside me sat Jonathan\\nWalton, an African-American\\nprofessor of religious studies and\\nprolific writer, and Mark Takano,\\nan erudite, openly gay former\\nDemocratic congressional\\ncandidate and local community\\ncollege trustee. In the middle of\\nour discussion, a dozen College\\nRepublicans stormed the front of\\nthe stage with signs denouncing\\nme as a \"left-wing hack\" while a\\nhysterical young man leaped from\\nthe crowd, blowing kisses\\nmockingly at Takano while\\nheckling Walton as a \"racist.\"\\nAfterward, university police\\nofficers insisted on escorting me\\nto my ride after the right-wing\\nheckler attempted to follow me as\\nhe shouted threats.\\nWho was this stalker? Just a\\nconcerned citizen worried about\\ntaxes? His name was Ryan Sorba\\nand he was an operative of a\\nheavily funded national\\nconservative youth outfit, the\\nIntercollegiate Studies Institute.\\nBesides founding dozens of\\nRepublican youth groups across\\nthe country, Sorba has devoted an\\nexceptional amount of energy to\\nhis interest in homosexuals. His\\nintellectual output consists of a\\ntract titled The Born Gay Hoax,\\narguing that homosexuality is at\\nonce a curable disease and a\\nbogus trend manufactured by\\nacademic leftists. Adding to his\\ncredentials, Sorba has a history of\\nrun-ins with the law, he explained\\nwhen I called him about the\\norder.\\nMy encounter with this\\naggressive right-wing cadre\\nseemed a strange, isolated event.\\nBut the hostility turned out to be\\nsymptomatic of the intensifying\\ncampaign to delegitimize\\nPresident Obama and his allies in\\nCongress. The Right\\'s days of\\nrage were only beginning.\\nThrough his first year in office,\\nObama seemed oblivious to the\\nthreat of the far right. He\\ncampaigned against partisanship,\\ndeclaring that there were \"no red\\nstates\" and no \"conservative\\nAmerica.\" Apparently, he thought\\nit was merely a contrivance or\\nmyth that there were people who\\nrejected science, demonized gays,\\nassailed minority and women\\'s\\nrights -- or that they genuinely\\nbelieved in what they said.\\nSpeaking of changing\\nWashington, Obama seemed to\\nthink that the entire history of\\npolitics since the rise of Reagan\\nand the Right and their strategies\\nof polarization was not deeply\\nrooted but a superficial problem\\nattributable to certain \"divisive\"\\npersonalities, easily wiped away\\nwith gestures toward\\nbipartisanship. His view of the\\nparties was that they were simply\\nmirror images sharing\\nfundamental beliefs but separated\\nby \"partisans.\" The skilled and\\ndevoted community organizer\\ncould bring them together.\\nMany of his supporters in the\\nmedia, often part and parcel of\\npolitical wars over the years,\\nreinforced and amplified his\\ninnocence, proclaiming he was\\nthe one at last who could \"bridge•\\nthe partisan divide.\" Andrew\\nSullivan, a disaffected\\nconservative who once called\\ncritics of George W. Bush\\npolicies \"fifth columnists\" but\\nnow fervently supporting Obama,\\nwrote that the new president was\\ndestined to become \"a liberal\\nReagan who can reunite\\nAmerica.\" This optimism\\npervaded the Obama White\\nHouse as the president and his\\naides sought out Republicans\\nwilling to vote for his programs.\\nAfter all, why couldn\\'t we all just\\nget along?\\nIn his autobiographical book The\\nAudacity of Hope, Obama\\nhighlighted a key component of\\nhis political strategy: \"I serve as a\\nblank screen on which people of\\nvastly different political stripes\\nproject their own views.\" Once he\\nwas elected, conservatives\\nconcluded that they could reverse\\nObama\\'s strength by transforming\\nhim into a human tableau for the\\nmost fearsome images they could\\nconjure.\\nObama\\'s multiracial background\\nwas crucial in cultivating\\nresentment among the shock\\ntroops. Those who rejected\\nObama\\'s legitimacy to serve as\\npresident on the basis of his\\nbackground gave birth to the\\n\"Birther\" movement that sought\\nto challenge his citizenship. The\\nmovement\\'s most visible figure,\\nand therefore the most eccentric,\\nwas Orly Taitz, a dentist and self-\\ntrained lawyer who had\\nimmigrated from the former\\nSoviet republican of Moldova to\\nIsrael before settling in the\\nconservative bastion of Orange\\nCounty, California. Convinced by\\nclaims on the far-right Web site\\nWorldNetDaily that Obama\\nplanned to create a \"civilian\\nnational security force,\" Taitz\\ntold me she \"realized that Obama\\nwas another Stalin--it\\'s a cross\\nbetween Stalinist USSR and\\nHitler\\'s Germany.\"\\nAfter becoming transfixed by\\nonline conspiracy theories\\nclaiming Obama\\'s family had\\nforged his birth certificate in\\nHawaii, Taitz snapped into\\naction. She filed a lawsuit in\\nNovember 2008 with California\\nSecretary of State Debra Bowen\\ndemanding an investigation into\\nObama\\'s eligibility to serve as\\npresident. Taitz\\'s plaintiff in the\\ncase was Wiley Drake, an Orange\\nCounty radio preacher and former\\nsecond vice president of the\\nSouthern Baptist Convention who\\nonce publicly prayed for Obama\\'s\\ndeath. While her lawsuit went\\nnowhere, and subsequent suits\\nearned her angry rebukes from\\njudges, Taitz became an instant\\nmedia sensation, delivering\\nheavily accented screeds against\\nObama before friendly\\ninterviewers from Sean Haimity\\nto CNN\\'s Lou Dobbs, who Taitz\\ncalled her \"greatest supporter\"\\nand who was eventually fired as\\nan indirect result of his hosting of\\nher.\\nIn March 2009, Texas Rep.\\nRandy Neugebauer signed on to a\\nBirther bill proposing that future\\npresidential candidates must\\nprove their citizenship before\\nbecoming eligible to campaign.\\nThe Birther movement had found\\nits voice in goverment and made\\nan indelible impact on the\\nRepublican grassroots. By June\\n2009, 28 percent of Republican\\nrespondents to a Kos/Research\\n2000 poll said they thought\\nObama wasn\\'t born in the United\\nStates, while 30 percent \"weren\\'t\\nsure.\" \"Obama should be in the\\nBig House,\" Taitz shrieked to me,\\n\"not the White House!\"\\nWhen Obama announced health\\ncare reform as the first major\\ninitiative of his administration,\\nthe conservative movement\\nactivated a campaign of\\ndemonization -- transformational\\npolitics -- designed to turn Obama\\ninto the \"Other,\" making him\\nseem as unfamiliar, and therefore\\nas threatening, as possible. When\\nthe president urged the Congress\\nto deliver a health care reform bill\\nin 2009, the Right staged a living\\ntheater of political hatred,\\nObama\\'s dream of bipartisanship\\ntransformed into a nightmarish\\nversion of \"Marat/Sade.\" On\\nSeptember 12, 2009, tens of\\nthousands of far-right activists\\nbelonging to a loose\\nconfederation of anti-government\\ngroups called the Tea Party\\nPatriots converged on\\nWashington\\'s National Mall for a\\ngiant protest against the Obama\\nhealth care plan. The date was\\nsignificant: Fox News\\'s top-\\nranked talk show host Glenn\\nBeck had declared the birth of the\\n\"9-12 Project\" to restore the sense\\nof unity -- and siege mentality --\\nthat Americans experienced on\\nSeptember 11, 2001. But this\\ntime, Obama -- not Osama -- was\\nthe enemy.\\nWhile covering the rally, I\\nwitnessed sign after sign\\ndeclaring Obama a greater danger\\nto America\\'s security than al-\\nQaida; demonstrators held images\\nthat juxtaposed Obama\\'s face\\nwith images of evildoers from\\nHitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;\\nothers carried signs questioning\\nObama\\'s status as a U.S. citizen.\\n\"We can fight al-Qaida, we can\\'t\\nkill Obama,\" said an aging\\ndemonstrator. Another told me,\\n\"Obama is the biggest Nazi in the\\nworld,\" pointing to placards he\\nhad fashioned depicting Obama\\nand House Majority Leader\\nNancy Pelosi in SS outfits.\\nAccording to another activist,\\nObama\\'s agenda was similar to\\nHitler\\'s: \"Hitler took over the\\nbanking industry, did he not? And\\nHitler had his own personal secret\\nservice police. [The community-\\norganizing group] ACORN is an\\nextension of that.\"\\nThe seemingly incongruous Tea\\nParty propaganda recalled signs\\nwaved by right-wing Jewish\\nsettlers during rallies against\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak\\nRabin and his support of the\\npeace process, portraying him as\\nan SS officer and as the French\\ncollaborator Marshall Petain. In\\n1995, amid the provocative\\natmosphere, a young right-wing\\nJewish zealot assassinated Rabin.\\nThe Israeli tragedy was a\\ncautionary example of targeted\\nhatred leading to violence.\\nMembers of the Tea Party\\n\"Patriots\" did not seem to care\\nthat their rhetoric was irrational,\\nor that comparing Obama to\\nHitler and Stalin was\\ncontradictory and obviously\\nhyperbolic. Their motives were\\nentirely negative. By purging\\ngovernment of the multicultural\\nevil that had seized power\\nthrough illicit means (several\\nactivists told me they believed\\nACORN helped Obama steal the\\nelection), they were convinced\\nthat a mythical golden American\\nyesteryear would return. They\\nhad no interest in building\\nanything new or even articulating\\nan agenda, much less discussing\\nthe merits of policies. The Tea\\nParty\\'s primary concern was\\ncultural purification -- freedom\\nfrom, not freedom to. Against the\\ndark image of the president and\\nhis liberal allies, Tea Party\\nactivists defined themselves as\\nthe children of light. The racial\\nsubtext was always transparent.\\nThe Tea Party\\'s strategy rested on\\na guerrilla campaign of chaos and\\nsabotage designed not only to\\nintimidate Democrats but also to\\ndisorient independent voters who\\nmight have supported health care\\nreform. The Tea Partiers were\\nconvinced this would be an easy\\nfeat, since they believed the\\nmajority of the country was on\\ntheir side -- that they represented\\nthe \"Real America.\" At the 9-12\\nrally Matt Kibbe, one of the\\nmarch organizers, told the crowd\\nthat ABC News was reporting\\nthat 1 million to 1.5 million\\npeople were in attendance,\\nsomething ABC denied, saying\\n\"ABCNews.com reported an\\napproximate figure of 60,000 to\\n70,000 protesters.\" Then Armey\\nled the crowd in a chant of\\n\"Freedom works! Freedom\\nworks!\" Unknown to most of the\\nTea Partiers, they were intoning\\nthe name of a corporate-funded\\nBeltway advocacy group, not the\\nbattle cry of Mel Gibson William\\nWallace in Braveheart.\\nContrary to its image as a\\ngrassroots movement mobilized\\nto stifle the machinations of\\nWashington elites, the Tea Party\\nmovement was the creation of a\\nconstellation of industry-funded\\nconservative groups with close\\nRepublican ties. The movement\\'s\\nleading puppet-master was Dick\\nArmey, who directed resources\\nand talking points to the Tea\\nParty \"Patriots\" from his\\nWashington, D.C.-based\\nadvocacy group, FreedomWorks.\\nAmong the corporate clients of\\nArmey\\'s lobbying firm, which he\\nwas forced to leave as a result of\\nhis involvement in the Tea\\nParties, was the pharmaceutical\\ngiant Bristol Myers Squibb, a\\ncompany with a clear interest in\\ndefeating health care reform.\\n(Armey\\'s other \"real American\"\\nclients included the Marxist terror\\ncult, People\\'s Mojahedin of Iran,\\nwhich received funding and\\nassistance from Saddam Hussein\\nin order to launch terrorist strikes\\nthroughout the 1990\\'s against\\nIranian civilian targets.) Armey\\ncollected a consulting fee of\\n$250,000 directly from\\nFreedomWorks and $300,000\\nfrom allied astroturf front groups.\\nFreedomWorks paid out much of\\nits money to an assortment of\\nRepublican political consultants.\\nIf Armey was the Tea Party king,\\nSarah PalM was eager to be\\ncrowned the Tea Party queen.\\nJust days after Obama\\'s\\ninauguration, Palin abruptly quit\\nher job as Alaskan governor to\\nvie for the honor. PalM\\'s motives\\nfor quitting became clear when\\nshe inked a lucrative deal to write\\nher political memoir Going\\nRogue, signed on as a regular\\ncontributor to Fox News, and\\nreceived $1 million an episode for\\na reality show on cable television,\\n\"Sarah Palin\\'s Alaska.\" PalM\\'s\\nbook tour, which sent her through\\nMiddle America in a luxuriously\\noutfitted bus, resembled both a\\npresidential campaign and a\\ntraveling carnival.\\nWhether or not PalM intends to\\nrun for president, her growing\\nmedia presence has magnified her\\ninfluence within the Republican\\nParty. Yet the ever-expanding\\nPalin phenomenon was greeted\\nwith hostility by Republican\\npoliticos desperately seeking to\\nexpand the party\\'s base after the\\ndrubbing in 2008. Former\\nMcCain campaign manager Steve\\nSchmidt warned that Palin\\'s\\nnomination in 2012 would be\\n\"catastrophic\" for the GOP. His\\ndoomsday prediction was backed\\nby an October Gallup poll\\nrevealing her as one of the most\\npolarizing and unpopular political\\nfigures in the country with a\\ndisapproval rating of over 50\\npercent. Unfortunately for\\nSchmidt and other party\\npragmatists, those who approve\\nof Palin represent the heartbeat of\\nthe Republican Party, its most\\nfervent activists, and cannot be\\ndissuaded from following her,\\neven if she is leading the party off\\na cliff.\\nA November 2009 special\\ncongressional election in New\\nYork\\'s heavily Republican 23rd\\ndistrict was the first major test of\\nPalin\\'s power. Along with a\\nparade of nationally recognized\\nconservatives, Palin endorsed\\nDoug Hoffman, an unknown far-\\nright third-party candidate closely\\nallied with the Tea Party, helping\\nto force a popular moderate\\nRepublican politician, Dede\\nScozzafava, from the race. In the\\nend, Palin\\'s ideological purge in\\nupstate New York led to an\\nimprobable Democratic victory,\\nthe first in that district in more\\nthan 100 years. After the disaster\\nPalin and her allies claimed\\nvictory, insisting they had at least\\nhastened the purge of\\nideologically impure Republicans\\nfrom the party. She went on to\\nendorse Rand Paul, the son of\\nright-wing libertarian Rep. Ron\\nPaul and a candidate in\\nKentucky\\'s GOP senatorial\\nprimary, while Dick Cheney went\\nout of his way to endorse Rand\\'s\\nregular Republican opponent,\\nTrey Grayson, the Kentucky\\nsecretary of state.\\nFollowing the Tea Party script of\\navoiding social issues like\\nabortion and gay marriage in\\norder to obscure the large\\npresence of the Christian Right\\nwithin the movement\\'s ranks, the\\nself-described \"hardcore pro-\\nlifer\" Palin recast herself as a\\nlibertarian concerned primarily\\nwith issues of \"economic\\nfreedom.\" She claimed the\\nDemocratic \"cap and trade\" plan\\nto limit carbon emissions would\\nharm the livelihood of blue-collar\\nworkers, and she assailed health\\ncare reform as a Trojan Horse for\\n\"socialism\" (though she admitted\\nher family \"used to hustle over\\nthe border\" to take advantage of\\nCanada\\'s single-payer health care\\nsystem). But no Palin attack had\\nas much effect as the one she\\nblasted out on her Facebook page\\nclaiming the Obama health care\\nplan included a provision for\\n\"death panels\" that would\\nrecommend euthanasia for\\nseverely ill patients like her\\nDown syndrome-afflicted son,\\nTrig. With the click of a button,\\nPalin transformed the tone of the\\nhealth care debate from rancorous\\nto poisonous.\\nThe source of Palin\\'s \"death\\npanels\" smear was a practiced\\npropagandist, former New York\\nLieutenant Governor Betsy\\nMcCaughey. When President Bill\\nClinton introduced health care\\nreform during his first term,\\nMcCaughey falsely claimed in an\\narticle published in the New\\nRepublic and widely circulated by\\nRepublicans, that the plan would\\nforce consumers to drop their\\nprivate plans and buy into the\\ngovernment\\'s program (the article\\nwould go on to win a National\\nMagazine Award and then be\\nretracted years later by the New\\nRepublic\\'s editors). Now she was\\nback in the spotlight, pushing a\\nrumor that would be voted by the\\nnon-partisan fact-checking Web\\nsite Politifact.com as \"the lie of\\n2009.\" McCaughey\\'s latest\\ninnuendo was boosted by the cult\\nof political crank Lyndon\\nLaRouche, which mobilized to\\npush the rumor into the\\nmainstream.\\nIn June 2009, one of LaRouche\\'s\\ntop lieutenants publicly\\nconfronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the\\nNational Institute of Health\\'s\\nchief bioethicist and brother of\\nWhite House chief of staff Rahm\\nEmanuel, accusing him of\\nseeking to reintroduce Hitler\\'s T-\\n4 program to kill the handicapped\\nthrough health care reform.\\n\"President Obama has put in\\nplace a reform apparatus reviving\\nthe euthanasia of Hitler Germany\\nin 1939, that began the genocide\\nthere,\" LaRouche staffer Anton\\nChaitkin charged. Soon,\\nLaRouche\\'s followers were on\\nstreet corners around the country\\nwith posters depicting Obama\\nwith a Hitler moustache. At a\\ntown hall forum on health care\\nreform hosted by Democratic\\nRep. Barney Frank, a LaRouche\\nfollower waved one of the\\nObama-as-Hitler posters and\\ndemanded, \"Why do you continue\\nto support a Nazi policy, as\\nObama has expressly supported\\nthis policy?\"\\nTwo months later, after Palin\\nwhispered the rumor on\\nFacebook, prominent\\nconservatives from former\\nSpeaker of the House Newt\\nGingrich to ranking Senate\\nFinance Committee member\\nCharles Grassley parroted her\\nclaims before audiences of\\nindignant Tea Partiers. Not to be\\noutdone, Glenn Beck devoted an\\nextended rant on his show to the\\nreality of death panels. Echoing\\nthe LaRouche cultists, Beck\\naccused Ezekiel Emanuel of \"the\\ndevaluing of human life, putting a\\nprice on each individual.\" He\\nthundered, \"The death panel is\\nnot a firing squad. Rationing is\\ninevitable and they know it!\"\\nThe death panel rumor served a\\nvariety of functions, all useful to\\nthe movement, but not necessarily\\nto the Republican Party. Most\\nimportantly, the rumor resonated\\nboth with hard-core libertarians\\nwho resented the very existence\\nof the federal government and\\nChristian Right activists who\\nviewed the legalization of\\nabortion as a slippery slope to\\ngovernment-sponsored\\neuthanasia. The hysteria it\\nengendered helped repair the rift\\nexposed by the Terri Schiavo\\ncharade in 2005, when the\\nevangelical conservative James\\nDobson publicly clashed with\\nArmey, the libertarian leader,\\nover the right of the government\\nto interfere in a private family\\nmatter of life and death.\\nThe slurring of Obama as a sort\\nof sleeper agent crypto-Muslim\\nhelped bring the neoconservatives\\nback into the fray. The new neo-\\ncon generation was led by Dick\\nCheney\\'s daughter, Liz, who\\nfounded an anti-Obama advocacy\\ngroup, Keep America Safe, by\\nleveraging donations from pro-\\nIsrael sources. Asked by CNN\\'s\\nLarry King about the Birther\\nmovement that was challenging\\nObama\\'s status as an American\\ncitizen, Liz Cheney remarked,\\n\"One of the reasons you see\\npeople so concerned about this is\\npeople are uncomfortable with\\nhaving for the first time ever, I\\nthink, a president who seems so\\nreluctant to defend the nation\\noverseas.\" With the libertarians,\\nChristian Right, and the neo-cons\\nseated around the same table,\\nunited in resentment of the alien\\npresident, the conservative\\nmovement was whole again.\\nThe experiments in \"Terror\\nManagement Theory\" of Sheldon\\nSolomon, professor of\\npsychology at Skidmore College,\\nJeff Greenberg, professor of\\npsychologist at the Unviersity of\\nArizona, and Tom Pyszczynski,\\nprofessor of psychology at the\\nUniversity of Colorado, have\\ndemonstrated the connection\\nbetween fear of death and\\nintensification of conservative\\nattitudes. The findings help\\nexplain the effectiveness of the\\ndeath panel rumor and\\ninsinuations by conservative\\nfigures that Obama was not truly\\nAmerican and somehow\\nsympathetic to Islamic terrorists.\\nIndeed, these seemingly irrational\\nsmears were guided by tactical\\nreasoning, calculated to agitate\\nvoters with constant reminders of\\ntheir own mortality. Whether or\\nnot Independents responded, the\\nrhetoric of death kept the Tea\\nParty crowd in a persistent state\\nof panic and rage, ensuring a\\nstanding army ready to fan out to\\nrallies and town halls at the first\\nsign of liberal malfeasance.\\nObama\\'s first year in office was\\nmarked by more than raucous\\nprotests; there were several\\ndisturbing murders committed by\\nfar-right extremists. In April\\n2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi\\nwannabe named Richard\\nPoplawsi mowed down a SWAT\\nteam of Pittsburgh cops, killing\\nthree. Poplawski\\'s best friend told\\nreporters the young killer \"grew\\nangry recently over fears Obama\\nwould outlaw guns.\" Later it was\\ndiscovered that Poplawski had\\nposted a video clip to a neo-Nazi\\nWeb site portraying Fox\\'s Glenn\\nBeck contemplating the existence\\nof concentration camps. (After a\\ncharacteristically thorough\\ninvestigation, Beck conceded\\nthey were not real.) On another\\noccasion, the killer posted a video\\npromoting Tea Party rallies. A\\nmonth after the Pittsburgh\\nbloodbath, Scott Roeder, a\\nsupporter of the militant anti-\\nabortion group Operation Rescue,\\nshot Dr. George Tiller to death\\nwhile he prayed at his church in\\nWichita, Kansas. Tiller was\\ndeclared fair game by the anti-\\nabortion movement because of\\nhis role as Kansas\\'s only late-term\\nabortion provider. During at least\\n28 episodes of Bill O\\'Reilly\\'s\\n\"O\\'Reilly Factor,\" O\\'Reilly had\\nreferred to Tiller as \"Tiller the\\nbaby killer,\" a criminal guilty of\\n\"Nazi stuff.\" \"I wouldn\\'t want to\\nbe [Tiller] if there is a Judgment\\nDay,\" O\\'Reilly proclaimed.\\nIn August 2009, a middle-aged\\nprofessional named George\\nSodini walked into a health club\\nin suburban Pittsburgh and\\ngunned down three women. The\\nmainstream press explained\\nSodini\\'s motives away by homing\\nin on passages in his online\\ndiaries describing his loneliness,\\ninability to convince women to\\nhave sex with him, and descent\\ninto chronic masturbation. Nearly\\nevery major media outlet omitted\\nor ignored a long deranged entry\\nin which Sodini projected his\\nsexual frustration onto Obama,\\nwhom he seemed to view as a\\nsymbol of black male virility and\\npredation.\\nThe day after Obama\\'s election\\nvictory, Sodini wrote: \"Good luck\\nto Obama! He will be successful.\\nThe liberal media LOVES him.\\nAmerika has chosen The Black\\nMan. Good! In light of this I got\\nideas outside of Obama\\'s plans\\nfor the economy and such. Here it\\nis: Every black man should get a\\nyoung white girl ... Kinda a\\nreverse indentured servitude\\nthing. Every daddy know when\\nhe sends his little girl to college,\\nshe be ... real good. I saw it. \\'Not\\nmy little girl\\', daddy says! (Yeah\\nright!!) Black dudes have thier\\n[sic] choice of best white??\\n[ellipses in original].\"\\nIn another posting to an anti-\\nClinton forum in 1994, during the\\nheight of the Republicans\\'\\nWhitewater investigation, Sodini\\nrevealed that he had purchased a\\nbumper sticker reading, \"Stop\\nSocialism, Impeach Clinton,\"\\nfrom a National Review ad. A\\nyear later, Sodini ranted on an\\nanti-government militia site, \"I\\nam convinced that more drastic\\naction is required to bring the\\ncountry back to the Constitutional\\norder that it was 200 years ago. I\\ndon\\'t think any group of political\\nleaders will achieve this for us.\"\\nWhether or not Sodini\\'s murder\\nspree was motivated by his\\npolitical passions, he was\\npathologically death-driven and\\nfixated on the phantasmagoria of\\nright-wing imagery. In his final\\ndiary entry, Sodini proclaimed,\\n\"Death lives!\"\\nMore than any other media figure\\nof the Obama era, Glenn Beck\\nencouraged the campaign of\\nracial demonization and\\nconspiracy that consumed the Tea\\nParty \"Patriots.\" During a\\nbroadcast of \"Fox and Friends,\"\\nBeck opined that Obama \"has\\nexposed himself over and over\\nand over again as a guy who has a\\ndeep-seated hatred for white\\npeople, or the white culture.\" As\\nevidence, Beck pointed to White\\nHouse green-jobs czar Van Jones,\\nan African American former\\ncommunity organizer who was\\neventually forced to resign as a\\ndirect result of Beck\\'s crusade.\\nFrom there, Beck targeted another\\nblack Obama adviser, Valerie\\nJarrett, highlighting her ties to\\nACORN while upholding her and\\nJones as evidence of Obama\\'s\\n\"socialist\" agenda. In another\\nbroadcast, Beck played an audio\\nclip of unidentified African\\nAmericans referring to \"Obama\\nmoney\" as they collected welfare\\nchecks in Detroit. Then he\\nshowed footage of members of a\\nKansas City-based youth group\\npracticing a step show, a\\ntraditional African-American\\ngroup dance apparently\\nunfamiliar enough to Beck and\\nhis transfixed audience that he\\nfelt at liberty to claim the footage\\nas evidence that \"Obama\\'s SS\"\\nwas being trained across inner-\\ncity America.\\nIn September 2009, Beck\\nrelentlessly targeted ACORN, the\\nRight\\'s new favorite hobgoblin,\\nadmitting that he intended to use\\nthe poor people\\'s advocacy group\\nto distract his viewers from the\\nhealth care debate. \"Trust me,\"\\nBeck said, \"Everybody now says\\nthey\\'re going to be talking about\\nhealth care. I don\\'t think so.\" (His\\nstatement was reminiscent of\\nRush Limbaugh\\'s scandal-\\nmongering remark during the\\nearly Clinton administration:\\n\"Whitewater is about health\\ncare.\") Beck promptly cued up a\\nseries of hidden camera videos\\nshot by conservative youth\\nactivists James O\\'Keefe and\\nHannah Giles inside ACORN\\nfield offices. In the videos,\\nO\\'Keefe baited African-American\\nstaffers into making statements\\nexplaining that Giles, who\\nclaimed she was a prostitute,\\ncould obtain low-income housing.\\nO\\'Keefe edited in images of\\nhimself clad in an outlandish\\npimp costume to create the\\nimpression that he was dressed\\nthat way during the meetings with\\nACORN; however, Giles later\\nadmitted her partner had lied\\nabout wearing his costume to\\nfarther ineriminate ACORN. In\\nthe end. ACORN was exonerated\\nof all criminal wrongdoing while\\nin a separate incident O\\'Keefe\\nwas arrested and charged with a\\nfederal crime after he and several\\nconservative pals disguised\\nthemselves as telephone\\nrepairmen and attempted to\\nwiretap phone lines in the office\\nof Senator Mary \\'Landrieu of\\nLouisiana. Like Ryan Sorba,\\nO\\'Keefe and his posse were\\nmovement cadres paid and\\ndirected by well-funded\\nconservative outfits; O\\'Keefe had\\nbeen trained by the Leadership\\nInstitute, the right-wing youth\\nFroup that nurtured leadinG, lights\\nlike Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove,\\nRalph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.\\nWhile O\\'Keefe and his buddies\\nplea-bargained with prosecutors,\\nBeck basked in his formula for\\nsuccess. His show earned the\\nhithest ratings at Fox News,\\ntopping network franchises like\\nO\\'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the\\nprocess. Beck\\'s opinions became\\nfirmly implanted in the nervous\\nsystems of Tea Party activists.\\n\"Glenn Beck has taught us\\neverything we know,\" a\\ndemonstrator at the 9-12 rally told\\nMe. \"He\\'s opened our eyes to so\\nmuch.\"\\nBut unlike the right-wing radio\\nwarhorses who helped usher in\\nNewt Gin<trich\\'s Republican\\ncounter-revolution of 1994, Beck\\nwas not an authentic product of\\nthe movement. When Rush\\nLimbaugh first began dominating\\nthe AM airwaves, Beck was\\nmired in the world of mid-level\\ncommercial radio, delivering\\ncorny yarns about lesbians and\\ncelebrity trash in hopes of\\nbecoming the next Howard Stem.\\nBy night, as he has tirelessly\\nrecounted, he medicated his\\nanxiety with cocaine and alcohol,\\ndestroying his first marriage in\\nthe process. \"We remember\\nGlenn from the womanizing, the\\ndrinking, the drugs. Everybody\\nwho knew him at the time saw\\nwhat a: complete mess he was,\" a\\nshock jock from Tampa, Florida,\\nwho called himself Bubba the\\nLove Sponge remarked to me\\nduring a broadcast of his\\nnationally syndicated show.\\nLike Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-\\npopulist demagogue of Elia\\nKazan\\'s 1957 film, A Face in the\\nCrowd. Beck was a self-\\ndestructive drifter Who might\\nhave been crumpled up with a\\nbottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an\\nalleyway or been locked away in\\n,a prison cell had fame not found\\nhim first. Beck was only able to\\nstabilize his life when he made\\nhis escape from freedom.,\\nmarrying a conservative Mormon,\\nconverting to her religion, and\\ntransmuting his urge to abuse\\ndrugs into conservative radio\\ndiatribes. When Beck first broke\\ninto television On CNN\\'s\\nHeadline News Channel, he\\nstruggled to articulate a coherent\\npolitical world view. If he\\ndistinguished himself from other\\nbig-time conservative .hosts in\\nany way, he did so through\\nstrained and often snide attempts\\nat humor, remnants of his failed\\nradio career. Nevertheless, with\\nhelp from his liberal agent,\\nMatthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a\\nprimetime slot at Fox News in\\nearly 2009. Around this same\\ntime, Beck began promoting the\\nwork of an arcane Mormon\\nconspiracy-peddler named W.\\nClean Skousen, whom he\\ndescribed as his political lodestar.\\nSuddenly, Beck had something\\nmore to offer than irritable mental\\ngestures.\\nThanks to Beck\\'s designation of\\nSkousen\\'s pseudohistorical tract\\nThe 5000 Year Leap as \"required\\nreading\" on the Web site of his 9-\\n12 Project, and his promotion of\\nthe book on his show, the\\npreviously obscure Skousen.\\nbecame the Hidden imam of the\\nTea Party movement. By the\\nsummer of 2009, Skousen\\'s Leap\\nwas among the top 10 books on\\nAmazon.com and a fixture on\\nliterature tables at Tea Party\\ngatherings. It went from selling a\\npuny couple of thousand copies in\\n2007 to selling over 200,000\\ncopies in 2009. Just why the book\\ngenerated such an instant appeal\\nis difficult to understand. It is\\nlittle more than a slapdash of\\nquotes from the Founding\\nFathers, often taken out of\\ncontext and deliberately\\noversimplified, to explain why\\nAmerica is the greatest nation in\\nhistory. in the process, Skousen\\nclaims that church and state\\nseparation is un-American, that\\n\"coercive taxation\" is communist,\\nand that marriage is the\\nunderpinning of a free society.\\nBenjamin Franklin., who wrote at\\nlength on the merits of \"amours\"\\nwith \"old women,\" and who\\nfamously solicited prostitutes and\\nfathered a son of out of wedlock,\\nwas the ultimate authority\\nSkousen quoted on the\\nimportance of marriage.\\nThough Skousen claims the\\nFounders as the world\\'s foremost\\nsource of eternal wisdom, he\\nbuttressed his points with fringe\\nsources like the conspiracist\\nNorman Dodd\\'s screeds about the\\nIlluminati. According. to Skousen,\\nDodd claimed that \"powerful\\ninfluences congregating in the\\nUnited States\" like the\\nRockefellers and the Rothschilds\\nhad forced the United States into\\nWorld War I. Skousen published\\nDodd\\'s manifestoes in his obscure\\njournal Freemen\\'s Digest, which\\nhe founded for the express\\npurpose of propagating\\nconspiracies.\\nSkousen\\'s paranoid politics were\\nan outgrowth of his participation.\\nin extreme anti-communist\\ngroups during the 1950s. He\\nboasted of a close friendship with\\nthen-FBI director J. Edgar\\nHoover and said he provided him\\nwith research on communist\\nplots, claims disputed by FBI\\nhistorians. (During a recent\\ninterview. Skousen\\'s son, Paul,\\ntold me that contrary to rumors of\\nHoover\\'s cross-dressing and\\nhomosexual dalliances, he would\\nset the top cop up on blind dates\\nwith live women.) Skousen was\\nfired from his job as Salt Lake\\nCity\\'s police chief for, in the\\nwords of the city\\'s conservative\\nMormon mayor, \"conduct[ing]\\nhi.s office as chief of police in\\nexactly the same manner in which\\nthe communists operate their\\ngovernment.\" From there,\\nSkousen sailed off to the far\\nshores of the Right-peddling\\nconspiracy tracts like The Naked\\nCommunist-, and earning\\ncondemnation from his beloved\\nFBI, which accused him in an\\ninternal memo of \"promoting\\n[his] own anti-communism for\\nobvious financial purposes.\"\\nSkousen\\'s vocal support for the\\nfar-right John Birch Society\\'s\\nclaim that communists controlled\\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower\\ncost him the support of the\\ncorporate backers who had paid\\nfor his Red-bashing lecture tours.\\nHe went off the radar for several\\nyears, returning during the late\\n1960s to accuse the Jewish\\nRothschild family of secretly\\nbankrolling everyone from Ho\\nChi Minh to the civil rights.\\nmovement. By the late 1970s,\\neven the Church of Latter Day\\nSaints distanced itself from\\nSkousen and his conspiracy\\ntheories. His work fell through\\nthe margins and might have\\ndisappeared entirely had Beck not\\nrevived it, turning The 5000 Year\\nLeap into the bible of the Tea\\nParty movement. Journalist\\nAlexander Zaitchik observed in\\nhis authoritative profile of\\nSkousen on Salon.com that\\nSkousen\\'s renewed influence\\nthrough Beck and the Tea Party\\n\\'suggests that the modern base of\\nthe Republican Party is headed to\\na very strange place.\"\\nBesides influencing Beck,\\nSkousen\\'s teachings inspired one\\nof the Tea Party movement\\'s most\\nvisible grassroots celebrities,\\nretired Sheriff Richard Mack. I\\nmet Mack in February at a far-\\nright rally just outside of\\nMontgomery, Alabama. On a\\nmakeshift stage towed into the\\nmiddle of a rodeo arena by a\\npickup truck, Mack recalled with\\nreverence his mentorship by\\nSkousen, who he said taught him\\neverything he needed to know\\nabout the Constitution. Mack\\nurged his spellbound audience to\\nstockpile ammo and store food.\\n\"If you control the food supply,\"\\nMack warned, \"you control the\\npeople. And that\\'s the first step to\\nslavery.\"\\nAlready a hero to conservatives\\nfor successfully suing the Clinton\\nadministration over the provision\\nin the Brady Handgun Violence\\nPrevention Act requiring law\\nenforcement to conduct criminal\\nbackground checks of gun\\npurchasers, Mack reemerged in\\nthe Obama era as the archetypal\\nlocal lawman who vowed to resist\\nthe tyrannical federal\\ngovernment. Along with a few\\ndozen former and active military\\nand law enforcement personnel,\\nMack helped form a self-styled\\nTea Party militia called the\\nOathkeepers. Galvanized by their\\nfear of creeping socialism, the\\nOathkeepers solemnly swore to\\nrefuse tyrannical federal orders\\nsuch as cooperating with foreign\\ntroops and forcing Americans\\ninto concentration camps.\\nBecause the group\\'s members\\ntrained for combat, the vow came\\nwith suggestion of armed\\nresistance.\\nBesides Mack, the Oathkeepers\\nattracted a coterie of militia\\nmovement retreads into its ranks.\\nThe most well-established figure\\nwas Mike Vanderboegh, a\\nlongtime militia fanatic who\\npublished a booklet in the mid-\\n1990s entitled Strategy and\\nTactics for a Militia Civil War,\\ncalling for sniper attacks on \"war\\ncriminals, secret policemen, rats.\"\\nWith Obama in office,\\nVandeboegh churned out anti-\\ngovernment screeds on right-wing\\nblogs with renewed passion and\\nsupported his efforts by cashing\\nin the $1,300 in federal disability\\ncompensation he received each\\nmonth.\\nFor all the energy the far right\\nexerted in its campaign to\\nstrangle Obama\\'s agenda, it was a\\nDemocrat who posed the greatest\\nthreat to the passage of health\\ncare reform. Representative Bart\\nStupak of Michigan had been in\\noffice since 1993, placing him\\namong the senior leadership of\\nthe so-called centrist Blue Dog\\nDemocrats. When health care\\nreform was introduced in\\nCongress, Stupak became the\\nleader of an informal caucus of\\nanti-abortion Democrats, making\\nhim the de facto swing vote on\\nthe House version of the bill. By\\nextension, Stupak was the point\\nman in the campaign to ensure\\nthat the bill would not allow\\nfederal funding for abortion for\\nlow-income women.\\nBut after close consultation with\\nleaders of the U.S. Conference of\\nCatholic Bishops, Stupak went a\\nstep further. He introduced a\\ndraconian amendment to block\\nwomen from paying for abortions\\nfrom even their own private\\ninsurance plans. The amendment,\\nwhich passed the House but was\\nshut down in the Senate, became\\na key sticking point in health care\\nnegotiations. \\'He\\'s a big hero\\nnow in the pro-life community,\"\\nformer Bush Catholic issues\\nadviser Deal Hudson told me in\\nNovember 2009. \"Thanks to him,\\nthis is the first time I can\\nremember the pro-life Democrats\\nhaving any power.\"\\nTo the chagrin of the\\nRepublicans, Stupak entertained\\noffers of compromise from the\\nDemocratic leadership.\\nAccording to Hudson, the\\nCatholic Bishops were keen to\\nsee health care reform pass, but\\nonly if the bill contained a clear\\nprovision forbidding patients\\nfrom spending federal money on\\nabortion. Finally, in March, after\\npressure from House Majority\\nLeader Nancy Pelosi, Obam.a\\nagreed to sign an executive order\\nforbidding the federal funding of\\nabortion. Stupak had been\\nmollified. Now he and his anti-\\nabortion caucus pledged to\\ndeliver the swing votes the\\nDemocrats needed to pass the\\nbill. As soon as reports seeped out\\ndeclaring the imminent passage\\nof health care reform, major\\nright-wing blogs like\\nRedState.org churned out virulent\\ndenunciations of Stupak, calling\\nhim a traitor and sellout. The blog\\ncomment sections filled up with\\ndozens of diatribes referring to\\nStupak in language previously\\nreserved for Dr. George Tiller:\\n\"Bart the Baby-Killer.\"\\nOn March 20, thousands of Tea\\nParty activists surrounded the\\nCapitol\\'s Longworth Building in\\nexpectation of Obama\\'s pep talk\\nto the House Democrats and the\\nhealth care vote. Democratic\\nRepresentative john Lewis, a\\nhero of the civil rights movement,\\nand Representative Barney Frank,\\nthe first openly gay member of\\nCongress, passed through the\\ncrowd on their way inside the\\nCapitol. Thsligger!\" a demonstrator\\nbarked at Lewis. Another called\\nFrank a \"faggot,\" eliciting\\nlaughter and cheers from nearby\\nprotesters. Meanwhile, as another\\nAfrican-American Democrat,\\nRepresentative Emanuel Cleaver,\\nascended the Capitol steps, a\\nprotester who had been screaming\\nat Lewis and Frank spat on his\\nface.\\nWith the demonstration carried\\non into the night, cries of \"Kill\\nthe bill!\\'\\' drifted into calls for\\nviolence. \"I would gladly stand\\nwith any of you men here and\\ntake these fascists down,\" a man\\nin camouflage battle dress\\nuniform proclaimed in front of an\\namateur videographer, pointing\\ntoward the Capitol. \"You haven\\'t\\nheard the last of me!\"\\nThe next day, Republican\\nmembers of Congress emerged\\nfrom the Longworth Building to\\nsalute the Tea Partiers. The\\ndemonstrators cheered wildly for\\ntheir proxies on the inside.\\nFinally, after hours of\\nimpassioned speeches on the\\nHouse floor, the bill passed. But\\nthe drama was hardly over.\\nRepublican Representative Joe\\nPitts, an anti-abortion Catholic\\nwho co-authored Stupak\\'s\\noriginal amendment, demanded a\\nmotion to bring it back to the\\nfloor for a vote, a transparent\\nexercise in grandstanding that\\nwas certain to fail. In response,\\nStupak rushed to the podium with\\na stinging rebuke to Pitts and the\\nRepublicans. \"The motion to\\ncommit does not support life,\"\\nStupak declared. \"It is the\\nDemocrats who have stood up....\"\\nHeckling from the Republican\\nside interrupted his statement. As\\nStupak looked around the House\\nchamber, Rep. Randy\\nNeugebauer, a right-wing\\nRepublican from Texas who\\nopenly supported the Birther\\nmovement, began shouting at him\\nfrom the backbench, \"Baby\\nkiller!\" Other Republicans joined\\nin, parroting base insults.\\nWhile the Republicans sank their\\nheads in defeat, some more\\nmilitant devotees of the Tea Party\\nmovement called for a right-wing\\nKristallnacht. \"If you wish to\\nsend a message that Pelosi and\\nher party cannot fail to hear,\\nbreak their windows,\"\\nVanderboegh of the Oathkeepers\\nwrote on a far-right blog hours\\nafter the bill passed. \"Break them\\nNOW. Break them and run to\\nbreak again.\" Within three days,\\nwindows and doors at Democratic\\nParty headquarters in New York,\\nKansas and Arizona had been\\nshattered.\\nMeanwhile, at least 10\\nDemocratic members of Congress\\nreported receiving death threats.\\nImages of nooses were faxed to\\nthe offices of Stupak and James\\nClyburn, an African-American\\ncongressman from South\\nCarolina. Representative Anthony\\nWeiner, an especially vocal\\nproponent of health care reform,\\nreceived a menacing letter filled\\nwith white powder. The brother\\nof Representative Torn Perriello,\\nanother health care supporter, had\\nhis home gas line deliberately\\nsabotaged after a local Tea Party\\norganizer posted his address\\nonline (he had meant to post the\\ncongressman\\'s) and encouraged\\nactivists to \"drop by\" to express\\ntheir anger about Perriello\\'s\\nrecent vote. In Tucson, Arizona,\\nthe windows of Democratic\\nRepresentative Gabrielle\\nGiffbrds\\' office were shattered by\\nshots from a pellet gun. And a\\nbrick was thrown through the\\nwindow of Representative Louise\\nSlaughter\\'s office in New York as\\nher voicemail filled with threats\\nof impending sniper attacks.\\nAfter the Passage of the health\\ncare bill, the Tea Party floated\\ninto a gray zone between\\nauthoritarianism and anarchy.\\nCrusading to restore a holy social\\norder, they promoted disorder.\\nClaiming to protect democracy,\\nthey smashed windows of elected\\nrepresentatives.

As evidenced by your activity over the\\npast several weeks your involvement in the peace process inevitably has deepened as the\\nneed for high-level U.S. intervention has grown. I believe that is a positive result. But\\nthe more fundamental issue remains what your role can and should be going forward in\\norder to maximize chances of diplomatic success.\\nI. . State of Play\\nAs the U.S. embarks on the next stage in the Israeli-Palestinian process, it faces a series\\nof tactical and strategic challenges regarding policy, politics and personality.\\n1. At a policy level, the meager results of indirect talks and difficulties in transitioning to\\ndirect talks have underscored the lack of trust between the two sides as well as\\nexisting substantive gaps. With direct talks begin in the coming days, one obstacles\\nwill have been removed, but several remain. Some or all of these may have been\\nresolved in connection with gaining agreement to direct talks.\\na. How to handle the renewal or non-renewal of Israel\\'s settlement moratorium?\\nb. What is the goal of the direct talks and is there a consensus on this matter\\nbetween the parties? A comprehensive agreement on permanent (CAPS) that\\ncovers all the details? A framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS)\\nthat outlines the governing parameters, along the lines of the 2000 Clinton\\nparameters? Or, less ambitiously, a short (one or two page) statement of\\nprinciples?\\nc. What role will the U.S. play? Will George or another U.S. official be present\\nin all meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is there an argument for\\nallowing the two sides to deal with one another without any intermediary, at\\nleast for a while, so that they do not seek to play to the U.S.?\\nd. What will the U.S. do in the event of an impasse or breakdown? Should it\\npresent bridging proposals and, if so, when?\\ne. How much work should be done, in parallel and simultaneously with the\\ndirect talks, between the U.S. and the Palestinians on the one hand and the\\nU.S. and Israel on the other?\\nBeyond those questions, I am persuaded the most important factor is and is likely to\\nremain what Netanyahu is prepared to do. You have witnessed first-hand how\\ndifficult it can be to deal with the Palestinians and the Arab world more generally;\\nhow fragile is Abbas\\'s political position; how indecisive they can be. Still, at bottom,\\nwe have a relatively clear sense of their positions on the core issues should we ever\\nreach a moment of truth. That is not the case with Netanyahu who either does not\\nknow himself or is not prepared to share and who, until now, has neither felt the\\nurgency to reach a deal nor the discomfort of the status quo.\\nAssuming Bibi can be convinced of the benefits of a deal along lines acceptable to the\\nPalestinians, this will not occur solely on the basis of his talks with Abbas, whom he\\nlikes but does not truly respect and who he fears will not be in a position to deliver.\\nRather, it will happen only if he feels that (1) it is under the leadership of a U.S.\\nadministration he genuinely trusts; (2) he is convinced that the combination of the\\nagreement and U.S. assurances meets his core needs in terms of Israeli security and\\ninternational recognition of its Jewish character; and (3) he feels that, again with U.S.\\nhelp, he can sell it to his people and survive -- or even thrive -- politically.\\nGetting Bibi to accept the core compromises will not be enough, of course. Other\\nbasic elements of the strategy must involve reaching out effectively to the Israeli\\npublic and ensuring strong, vocal Arab support for a U.S.- sponsored deal without\\nwhich Abbas cannot say yes and Israelis will lack the incentive to do so. But the\\npoint is that a prerequisite for a successful peace effort is for the U.S. to convince the\\nprime minister -- through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure -- to\\nmake the necessary compromises. At the end of the day, if Bibi is to make a deal, it\\nwill be a deal with the U.S. as much as with the Palestinians.\\n2. At a political level, the past year has clearly demonstrated the degree to which the\\nU.S. has been hamstrung by its low ratings in Israel and among important segments of\\nthe domestic Jewish constituency. This is a critical dimension not for electoral\\nreasons, but because the U.S.\\'s best chance of influencing Bibi is to build support for\\na deal in Israel and at home among those who care most. That capacity has been\\nimproved to some extent as a result of the successful July visit by Netanyahu and the\\nstring of military/security deals between our two countries. But we must be honest:\\nthere sill is a long way to go. If anything, the recent Obama/Bibi illustrated a new,\\npotentially perverse dynamic: the U.S. president at this juncture needs the Israeli\\nprime minister to validate his pro-Israeli credentials more than the Israeli prime\\nminister needs the U.S. president to vouch for his pro-peace ones.\\n3. At the level of personalities, George, with all his skill and perseverance, cannot by\\nhimself secure serious concessions from the parties by himself. In recent discussions,\\nboth Israelis and Palestinians described him as someone they respected but to whom\\nthey would not make major concessions. This is the curse of the day-to-day\\nnegotiator. When they are ready to deal, they will only deal with the players they\\nperceive with authority. It was not different for Dennis during the Clinton\\nAdministration. This does not mean that Mitchell does not have a crucial role going\\nforward. Indeed, he can be empowered by your more active involvement.\\nThe president faces a different but no less difficult problem. He is not trusted in\\nIsrael and, though the July meeting might have altered the situation somewhat, not\\ntrusted by Bibi. Domestically, he faces a reservoir of skepticism on this issue which\\nreflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, but which could obstruct his\\neffectiveness both as an interlocutor and as a salesman. Besides, as we learned during\\nWJC\\'s presidency, it would be a mistake for Obama to get too deeply invested in\\nnegotiations prior to the end-point; he does not have the time and should not expend\\nthe political capital prematurely. To do so, moreover, would automatically be to\\ndevalue the role of anyone beneath him, thus making the peace process as a whole\\nexcessively dependent on his involvement.\\nYour Role\\nUnder these circumstances, in my view, your deeper involvement is both essential and\\npotentially highly beneficial. It should be a selective involvement; Mitchell still must be\\nthe day-to-day negotiator and others also must play a part. In particular, I would not\\nrecommend you get overly mired in the details of the direct talks or the set of questions I\\ndescribed above (about their format, goal, U.S. role, etc) other than at critical junctures.\\nNor would I advise you to get pulled into a Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy which\\nwould quickly depreciate your value.\\nRather, by injecting yourself strategically at the right time and in the right way, you could\\nfill the gaps identified above. This is because you are uniquely placed to address the\\nneed both for a higher-level mediator and for someone who enjoys considerable\\ncredibility in Israel and the U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently he was prepared\\nto deal substantively with Obama and with you).\\nYour role would be twofold\\n1. To serve as the higher-level interlocutor on matters offinal status. To a large\\ndegree, Abbas\\'s positions are already known; they will have to be further explored\\nand he will have to be pushed, and you should engage him. But we probably know\\nhis zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suited\\nto begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns,\\nhow they can be met, what he would need from us and others, and how far, at the end\\nof the day, he is prepared to go with the Palestinians if his security and other needs\\nare met. Bibi knows and trusts you; in fact, you are almost certainly the high-level\\nU.S. official he trusts most. If you succeed in taking him into your confidence and\\nwork with him over time, you could pave the way for an Israeli-U.S. understanding\\nthat would underpin an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, this will require\\nbeing tough and pushing back against some of his most extreme demands (the\\nmilitarily questionable request for a very long term Israeli presence in the Jordan\\nValley being one of them) and proposing more rational alternatives. But the point is\\nthat without getting Bibi to trust and level with us, without him feeling both what he\\nhas to lose but also what he has to gain, this process is unlikely to go anywhere.\\nTo repeat, this should not be at Mitchell\\'s expense. It should be a parallel,\\nreinforcing process in which you would deal one-on-one with Abbas and Netanyahu\\nat periodic intervals, for extensive periods of time.\\n2. To help restore the US. \\'s image and credibility in Israel and among important\\ndomestic constituencies. You have the history, background and credentials to do so\\nhere and in Israel and thus to overcome some of the suspicion with which Obama\\nmust contend. Over time, through a series of visits and public statements, you would\\nseek to make the case for a peace agreement in positive terms, focusing on what\\nbenefits it would bring to Israelis rather than on the costs they would incur: secure\\nand recognized borders; stronger security ties to the U.S. and others; an end to the\\nconflict; normal relations with the Arab world; and strengthened international\\nlegitimacy.\\nIII. Potential Downsides and Responses\\n1. Dragging you into the weeds of negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated\\nmeetings with Bibi and Abbas, you will be drawn into detailed discussions over the\\nnature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. This\\nwould be unhelpful both to the process and to you. There is a fine line between\\ndiscussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details of\\nthat outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extract\\nfrom Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements on\\nthe Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and\\nminimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respective\\nnegotiators work out the details\\n2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creating\\nthe sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besides\\npotentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests for\\nthe reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remaining\\nsomewhat removed from the day-to-day specifics of the talks. In fact, as I see it, this\\nprocess could and should end up strengthening George\\'s presently hand by clarifying\\nit. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two of\\nyou will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that\\nreflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger and\\nclearer mandate than currently is the case.\\n3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the most\\nsignificant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly. Failure is a real possibility.\\nPalestinians are in disarray. The Arab world is profoundly divided, with forthcoming\\nsuccessions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon which\\nwe most rely. And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi\\'s politics, his head and\\nhis heart. As a result, a powerful argument could be made that you would be better\\noff keeping at arms\\' length from this process, especially given how much else is on\\nyour plate. That said, I disagree for the following reasons:\\na. By not getting involved, you risk the worst of two worlds: being associated\\nwith a failure (which, by virtue of your position, you inevitably would be) and\\nbeing criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it.\\nb. Over the past year and a half, you have been involved -- traveling to the\\nregion; seeking to convince Abbas to enter into talks; commenting on the\\nsettlement freeze in Jerusalem -- and you will not be able to escape that kind\\nof involvement in the future. The problem is that your engagement has\\nappeared to be sporadic rather than strategic -- that you\\'ve been deployed\\nwhen it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than in\\norder to implement a long term, well thought-out plan. I do not think that has\\nserved you well.\\nc. While one cannot by any means be confident of success, I believe an\\nagreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectively\\nto bring Bibi into a position where he believes that the costs of a historical\\ncompromise are outweighed by its benefits.\\nd. If we don\\'t try all we can over the next year or year and a half, you will in all\\nlikelihood be forced to deal extensively with the Middle East -- albeit not in a\\npeacemaking but in a crisis-managing mode. Without movement on the\\npeace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad\\'s state-building plan could be gone\\nin smoke, hostilities might break out between Israel, Syria and Hizbollah and\\nthe U.S. would have to deal with Iran in an even less hospitable regional\\nclimate.Unfortunately, we just received our first news query on the North Korea consular visit, out of the region.

Its revival is testimony to the increased\\nchill in relations between the Koreas in recent months.\\nIn the past week, North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the name uriminzok, or \"our nation.\"\\nBoth the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user named \"uriminzokkiri.\" The Web site\\nwww.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, a propaganda agency in\\nPyongyang.\\nLee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said, \"It is clear that these accounts carry the same\\npropaganda as the North\\'s official news media, but we have not been able to find out who operates them.\"\\nThe two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korea\\nresumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May, when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships, killing 46\\nsailors.\\nNorth Korea, which denies involvement, has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter and\\nYouTube, with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outside\\nworld.)\\n\"YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda,\" said Paik Hak-soon, an analyst at Sjong\\nInstitute. \"But fundamentally, it\\'s not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash out\\ndesperately in the face of mounting international pressure.\"\\nDuring the cold war era, South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years ago,\\nduring the brief era of its \"sunshine policy\" of engaging the North, the South allowed its people access to North Korean\\nWeb sites. But today, when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account, a\\ngovernment warning against \"illegal content\" pops up.\\nThese blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their own\\nopinions about the totalitarian North.\\nBut the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinking\\nof the South Korean warship, including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in the\\nSouth.\\nThe Twitter account, which provides links to the North Korean Web site, had 928 followers as of Monday. But a few\\nYouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views.\\nIn one such clip, North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, who recently criticized \"pro-\\nNorth Korean youths\" who voted for the opposition in the June local elections, saying, \"If they like the North so much,\\nthey should go and live under Kim Jong-il.\"\\nThe clip\\'s narrator calls Mr. Yu a \"pro-American flunky\" and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living \"mopping the floor of the\\nPentagon.\"\\nAnother clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the \"American imperialists\" because it was armed\\nwith nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche, or ideology of \"self-reliance\"; and because of a philosophical\\ntreatise written by Kim II-sung, the North\\'s founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il, who died in 1994.\\n\"I don\\'t think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans,\" said Yoo Ho-yeol,\\nan expert on North Korea at Korea University here. \"People watch this for fun, not to be influenced.\"8:15 am DEPART Private Residence\\nEn route State Department\\n8:25 am ARRIVE State Department\\n8:25 am PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFING\\n8:30 am Secretary\\'s Office\\n8:30 am DAILY SMALL STAFF MEETING\\n8:45 am Secretary\\'s Office\\n8:45 am DAILY SENIOR STAFF MEETING\\n9:15 am Secretary\\'s Conference Room\\n9:30 am MEETING w/LISSA MUSCATINE\\n10:00 am Secretary\\'s Office\\n10:10 am PHOTOS\\n10:15 am Secretary\\'s Outer Office\\n10:15 am VIDEOS (6)\\n10:30 am George Marshall Room, 7th Floor\\n10:30 am BRIEFING w/STAFF\\n12:00 pm Secretary\\'s Conference Room\\n12:00 pm OFFICE TIME\\n12:30 pm Secretary\\'s Office\\n12:30 pm OTR LUNCH\\n2:00 pm Secretary\\'s Outer Office\\n2:00 pm OFFICE TIME\\n2:30 pm Secretary\\'s Office\\n2:30 pm MEETING w/JOSE FERNANDEZ\\n3:00 pm Secretary\\'s Outer Office\\n3:00 pm MEETING w/UNGA TEAM\\n3:30 pm Secretary\\'s Outer Office\\n3:30 pm OFFICE TIME\\n6:00 pm Secretary\\'s Office\\n6:00 pm DEPART State Department\\nEn route Private Residence\\n6:10 pm ARRIVE Private Residence\\n###Fyi, note I sent to Denis.Blago found guilty of lying to the FBI; will be retried on the other 23 counts; jury hung on 27 counts\\n(4 agst his brother)###no word from mashabane yet.\\nOr menendez (though menendez did try my cell while I was on plane) And alexander is available all day tomorrow till\\n1pm if u want to call.I did not.

Sid\\nDoes Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to \"Senior Economic Policy Makers\" to Get So\\nMany Things Wrong?\\nDean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.\\nWednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04\\nThomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: \"over the past few weeks I\\'ve had a chance to\\nspeak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany.\" This might lead readers to believe that\\nhe is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to these\\nsenior economic policy makers.\\nReaders with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than\\nwhat can be found on the Washington Post\\'s editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the\\nusual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the\\npresent seriously wrong.\\nStarting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:\\n\"we\\'ve just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to\\ngive ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term\\ninvestments in new growth engines.\"\\nThe main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due\\nto the fact that China lent to us. China\\'s lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to\\nmaintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also\\ntried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other\\ncountries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large\\nand growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,\\npreventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing\\nbubble) until just before the crash.\\nThere is no reason whatsoever to believe that China\\'s decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by\\nthe Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do\\nwith our borrowing from China. The issue was China\\'s decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given\\nthe weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic\\nproduction without borrowing from abroad.\\nFriedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses\\'\\nreluctance to hire as the result of \"unusual uncertainty,\" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman\\nBen Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance\\nto hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their\\ndemand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.\\nThis is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase\\nin hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far\\nshorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.\\nLater he tells readers:\\n\"America\\'s solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the\\nrise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and\\niF\\'hones, technology is destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than ever\\nwhile spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.\"\\nThis is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidence\\nwhatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for\\nless educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers\\nmight think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level),\\ncoupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly\\neducated workers as well as less educated workers.\\nFriedman\\'s proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:\\n\"There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that\\ncan pay workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs over\\ntheir global competitors. There is no other way.\"\\nWe better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentile\\non the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredible\\naccomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?\\nFriedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany\\'s past and present wrong:\\n\"Keeping up with Germany won\\'t be easy. A decade ago Germany was the \\'sick man of Europe.\\' No more. The\\nGermans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and\\nworker flexibility, while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.\"\\nGermany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven\\'t,\\nbut its past as the \"sick man of Europe\" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany\\nalways ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country\\'s competitiveness: foreigners are buying\\nits goods. Germany\\'s unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7\\n.,5_percept, not hugely different than its current 7.0\\npercent rate.\\nThe story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in\\nspite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of\\ndemand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy,\\ngreater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the\\neconomy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that\\nincreased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.\\nThe longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman\\'s sources don\\'t\\nhave access to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will be\\ncontrolled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, but it seems that it\\nwould have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course, if we have not fixed our health care system,\\nwe can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries.\\nIf Friedman\\'s intention was to scare us, he succeeded. After all, if senior economic policy makers in the U.S.\\nand Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies, then we can expect some very had times ahead.Ebeling, Betsy <\\nWednesday, August 18, 2010 12:10 PM\\nH\\nRE:I don\\'t want to keep you hanging all evening.

Sid\\nhttp://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistan\\niNT aLOSE\\nThe military and the mullahs\\nWilliam Dalrymple\\nPublished 23 August 2010\\nThe Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India.\\nIt is proving a fatal alliance.\\nIt May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country\\'s inscrutable chief of\\narmy staff, the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.\\nFor a start, the army\\'s response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan\\'s civilian\\npoliticians, guided by their chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment, he was nicknamed\\n\"Mr 10 Per Cent\"; he has now been upgraded to \"Mr 110 Per Cent\"). This has led to discussion in army circles about\\nwhether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is this\\nthreat, that one of the country\\'s most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief of the Friday\\nTimes, went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup.\"( know this is\\ndefinitely being discussed,\" he said.\\nThen there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: \"an extraordinary\\nsituation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it\", explained a brigadier, writing in the Nation newspaper.\\nKayani, a former head of Pakistan\\'s notorious intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, can now continue\\nto run the army, and by default Pakistan\\'s foreign policy, until November 2013.\\nBut Kayani\\'s biggest triumph this year, arguably the greatest of his career, was his visit to Kabul in July as the honoured\\nguest of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations, which\\nhave been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah Saleh,\\nKarzai\\'s pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as a\\nmujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Indian-backed \"Lion of Panjshir\". The Taliban, and their sponsors in\\nthe ISI, had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent, something Saleh was enormously proud of.\\nWhen I had dinner with him in Kabul in May, he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai\\'s\\ngovernment in taking the fight to the Taliban, and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid, arm and train its\\npuppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh\\'s sacking gave notice of an important change of direction\\nby Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obama\\'s Af-Pak adviser, said when the news broke, \"it means that Karzai is already\\nplanning for a post-American Afghanistan\". •\\nIt seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-\\nsponsored elements in the Taliban, maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani, which could give over much of the Pashtun\\nsouth to pro-Pakistan Taliban, but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of India,\\nPakistan\\'s great regional rival, from Afghanistan, or at least the closing of its four regional consulates, would be a top\\npriority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.\\nWith the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks, Pakistan\\'s influence disappeared abruptly from\\nAfghanistan and\\nIndia quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISI\\'s horror, in the early years of this decade, India provided reconstruction\\nassistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, the new Afghan parliament\\nand free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As General\\nStanley McChrystal put it in a report last year, \"while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people, increasing Indian\\ninfluence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures\".\\nMcChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. \"We\\nhave strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan\\'s interests to destabilise Pakistan,\" a foreign\\nministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan\\'s military establishment, terrified of the economic superpower emerging\\nto the south, believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - a\\npotential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital\\n\"strategic depth\".\\nAccording to Indian diplomatic sources, there are still fewer than 3,600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indian\\ndiplomatic officers, as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to risk\\nPakistan\\'s relationship with its main strategic ally, the US, in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership under\\nISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai\\'s new deal with the Pakistanis, and his\\nclear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban, therefore represents a major\\nstrategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan\\'s military, as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.\\nPakistan\\'s support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadi\\nmovements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan\\'s army saw violent Islamic\\ngroups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with the\\nretreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managed\\nwith great effect from 1990 onwards).\\nThe former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul, who was largely responsible for developing the strategy,\\nonce said to me: \"If the jihadis go out and contain India, tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil, for a\\nlegitimate cause, why should we not support them?\" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the Berlin\\nWall presented to him by the city\\'s people for \"delivering the first blow\" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis in\\nthe 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his \"retirement\".\\nThe Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a taped\\nconversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan, his chief of general staff, that India\\nreleased in 1999, Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their \"tooti\" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followed\\ntheir own agendas, sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan\\'s religious minorities and political leaders, but\\neven the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence against\\nIndian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim, so\\nmuch as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.\\nThe army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs public\\npromises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked on\\nplans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai\\'s\\nregime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve, to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabul\\nonce the American gaze had turned elsewhere.\\nSo it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. Mullah\\nMohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb of\\nPashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.\\nGulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-lslami, was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freely\\noutside Peshawar, while Jalaluddin Haqqani, one of the most violent Taliban commanders, was given sanctuary in North\\nWaziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.\\nBy 2004, the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering them\\na few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistani\\narmy officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agencies\\nconcluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban, turning a blind eye as they raised\\nfunds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban, with covert Pakistani\\nsupport, were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returned\\nto their bases in Pakistan.\\nAt the same time, Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified, beginning the process of turning the\\nAfghan conflict, like that in Kashmir, into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twice\\nbombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Research\\nand Analysis Wing (Raw), the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died in\\nthe blasts.\\nThe degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear, and not just in the\\ndocuments published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard, based\\non interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents how the IS! \"orchestrates, sustains and\\nstrongly influences\" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban\\'s supreme leadership\\ncouncil, the Quetta Shura.\\nMeanwhile, in the Punjab, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the man believed to have been\\nbehind the 2008 Bombay attacks, has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke, near Lahore. \"The powerful\\nwestern world is terrorising Muslims,\" he told a conference in Islamabad this year. \"We are being invaded, manipulated\\nand looted. We must fight the evil trio of America, Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. In\\nfact, a suicide attack is the best form of jihad.\"\\nAt the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis, Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generous\\nassistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both the\\nmilitants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley and\\nannounced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others in\\nthe Federally Administered Tribal Areas, more than 1,500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250,000\\npeople were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any members\\nof the Afghan Taliban who didn\\'t follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi, in February, of the Taliban second-in-\\ncommand, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded as\\ninfringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis, without ISI clearance.\\nYet, even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas, the seventh, North\\nWaziristan, has been left alone, as it is home to the ISI\\'s favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan\\'s\\nfoot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay, and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groups\\nin Pakistan over the past few months, show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer, the chief\\nminister of the Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in the\\nPakistani Punjab, or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still, in the eyes of many in the Pakistani\\nestablishment, good Taliban and bad Taliban, useful militants and expendable ones.\\nIn their eyes, the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan, with US and British troops suffering record casualties last\\nmonth, is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan and\\nDelhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -\\nresuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban\\'s takeover of the south, and here India is working\\nin conjuction with Russia, Iran and the central Asian \"stans\". The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon,\\nwas despatched to Afghanistan in March, and the foreign minister, S M Krishna, has visited Tehran. Post-American\\nAfghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtun\\nsouth, either formally, with a partition, or more likely, to slip into inter-ethnic civil war, with India supporting and arming\\nthe north and Pakistan the south.\\nAs diplomacy gathers pace, the Afghan Taliban, who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue to\\nincrease their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peaceful\\nnorth, where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of the\\nBritish aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result.\\nIn Pakistan. too, jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country, killing roughly\\n3,000 people and the ISI this week stated that, for the first time in the nation\\'s history, it regarded home-grown Islamic\\nmilitants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In a\\nrecent speech, Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy, it was against Indian attacks\\nthat he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan\\'s economy is in crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic and\\nthe educational system in complete breakdown, Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country\\'s defence budget.\\nIt is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests in\\nthe region. Worst of all, because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph, it is unlikely to change its policy any\\ntime soon.\\nWilliam Dalrymple\\'s \"Nine Lives: in Search of the Sacred in Modern India\" won the first Asia House Literary Award in\\nMay and is newly published in paperback (Bloomsbury, £8.99)Nice work from one of our star PAO\\'s --- Joann Lockard in Kampala\\nimYesJustin printing for you\\nTalked to einhorn, he doesn\\'t have mtg till 1pm.

Suppose, too, that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then, though not by the landslide of 1932. How\\ndifferent subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employment\\ncollapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened.\\nOn such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power close\\nto the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alas,\\nit was not. I noted on February 4 2009, at the beginning of the new presidency: \"Instead of an overwhelming fiscal\\nstimulus, what is emerging is too small, too wasteful and too ill-focused.\" A week later, I asked: \"Has Barack Obama\\'s\\npresidency already failed? In normal times, this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They are\\ntimes of great danger. Today, the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow, it will own\\nit. Today, it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. Today, it is in control of events; tomorrow,\\nevents will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much.\" This was right.\\nThe direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers — though not all economists — had learnt a great deal from the 1930s.\\nSensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed, together with reconstruction of the\\nfinancial sector.\\nBut, as Larry Summers, Mr Obama\\'s chief economic adviser, had said: \"When markets overshoot, policymakers must\\novershoot too\". Unfortunately, the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claim\\nthat policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate.\\nIn consequence, the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion have\\ndisappeared. With the Federal Reserve cautious, too, the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavy\\njoblessness is high. So, too, are the chances of domestic and global political friction.\\nTrue, the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this one\\nwere far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman of the\\nFed, and Mark Zandi of Moody\\'s argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model to\\nassess what would have happened without any intervention, without the financial interventions (including monetary policy)\\nand without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have been\\nclose to 12 per cent with no policy response, compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly, the\\nunemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent, instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would also\\nhave meant a fiscal deficit of $2,600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal response\\nbut no financial •olic res•onse. It is a little better the other way round.\\nThe implication that the modest stimulus package of February 2009 — a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP, spread over\\nseveral years — made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it argues\\nthat in 2010, US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and\\n1.8 percentage points lower, as a result of the package.\\nPanglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium, unless governments intervene, disagree. I wish\\nthere were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowing\\nthe collapse of much of the financial system, avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscal\\ndeficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre.\\nA fascinating perspective does come, however, from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. The\\nrecession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small, but the decline in employment has been exceptionally\\nlarge, as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen to\\noutput and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of the\\nstimulus.\\nSince the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis, the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover, since\\nfiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output, not jobs, this is a policy success. At the same time, the\\nenthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt, some of this is due to the collapse in\\nconstruction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives for\\nmanagers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs.\\nDebate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer, from European experience, is\\nthat one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run, the simplest way to prevent that from\\nhappening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market, not the slightest threat of\\ninflation — far more a risk of deflation — and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary and\\nfiscal stimulus, these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet, alas, the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep and\\nthe administration has lost the initiative.\\nSo what is going to happen? I assume that, after the midterm elections, resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts and\\nignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus, though it is much the same\\nthing — increasing fiscal deficits, thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It would\\nhave to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them, so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their\\n\"yacht and mansion-led\" recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this. Those\\nwho were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price.\\nmartin.wolf@ft.com\\nMore columns at www.ft.com/martinwolf\\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

Yet the report passed with little fanfare and even less media attention—like so many other\\naspects of the president\\'s remarkably pro-woman policy agenda.\\nIt\\'s almost tragic how this agenda has fallen under the radar during Obama\\'s first two years in office. We\\nhear too often about abortion\\'s controversial role in the year-long health care negotiations—but not\\nenough about other women-centered issues that, after being promoted by activists for years, have finally\\nmade it into legislation. These go beyond the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The American Reinvestment\\nand Recovery Act dramatically expanded child care provisions and Head Start. The health cafe bill\\ncontained over $i billion to support nurses visiting new and expectant mothers at home, a program that\\nwomen\\'s groups and economists alike have championed as a smart investment. An even bigger victory is\\nthe CLASS Act, also part of the health care bill, which provides a basic cash benefit to people (often\\nwomen) who are taking care of the elderly at home.\\nYet I can probably count on my hand the number of people, including women, who actually know about\\nthese new laws. Amid the din of bad news about the economy and misinformation about health care\\nreform, these policies don\\'t stand a chance, sadly, of getting much media coverage. it doesn\\'t help that the\\nDemocrats haven\\'t done enough to shine a public spotlight on them.\\nBut they could soon be lost in an even deeper abyss: The rampant individualism and free-market\\nfundamentalism support-ed by the Republican Party, which seems on the 1\\n.Drecipice of controlling -die\\nHouse and possibly the Senate, could undo these initiatives entirely. What\\'s more, the new Republiicpm\\nwave could mute the voice of women and their most important advocates on the national stage.\\nThe Ten Parties, fueled by wealthy multimillionaires, are running extreme candidates—including\\nwomen like Sharron Angie and Christine O\\'Donnell—who want to get rid of policies that help women the\\nmost. If the health care bill gets repealed, for instance, the new provisions for !ong-term care would go out\\nthe window, making decades worth of advocacy work moot.\\nBut the Tea Parties threaten women in other ways, too. .ff the Republicans take back the _House, the\\nDemocratic Party will lose one of its most powerful women: Speaker Nanc,\\n„\\' Pelosi, who currently has more\\nclout than any woman on the other side of the aisle, Meanwhile, Republicans like Sarah Palin and Nikki\\nHaley will only gain political power—and, with that .power, attract more attention to their extreme views.\\nIf these Republicans become the nation\\'s loudest voices of seemingly strong women, that could portend\\nfor a shift among younger women\\'s allegiances toward the Republican Party and its platform.\\nAlready, despite the stark realities about what Republicans will likely take away from women once. they are\\nin power, we are seeing rumbling of such a change: After forming the backbone of Democratic majorities\\nfor years, working-class women are wobbling in theii support the the Obama administration. According to\\na fron. last week, while femaie college graduates savor Democratic over\\nRepublican control (56 percent to 36 percent), women With only some college or a vocational education\\nare running almost even k A • \\'\\nPerhaps, in their growing economic anxiety, this group of women wafits to throw out incumbents they\\nperceive have not sufficiently focused on their economic progress. But, of course, if the media paid more\\nattention to Obama\\'s pro-woman agenda—and both advocates and policymakers did more to broadcast\\nit—these key voters would know that the Democrats, not Republicans, are the politicians who have their\\ninterests in mind.\\nDemocrats can\\'t let this continue—they can\\'t allow Republicans to brand themselves as the party of strong\\nfemale leaders, or allow women to gradually become a constituency of the right. That\\'s why it\\'s critical to\\nhave standout women in the party. If Pelosi loses, is there a powerful enough Democratic woman to\\ncompete with these Republicans in the national spotlight? There\\'s Hillary Clinton who, as Secretary of\\nState, has sent a powerful signal to the country and the world about the importance of female leadership in\\nthe Obama administration, But, as a technically non-partisan international figure, Hillary won\\'t be able to\\ndo public battle with the rising right,\\nPerhaps a Governor Sink—if she wins—in Florida could be among a new class of strong female Democrats.\\nThe °barna administration would also do well to elevate v.,/onien in the exe.cutive branch and turn public\\nattention to those who are already there.\\nIn addition to •presenting women as the face of the patty, Democrats must focus on issues like long-term\\ncare, child care, and equal pay, all of which could rise to the legislatle fore in the coming months.\\nRepublicans will likely directly attack or cut beck investments in these initiatives. When this happens, the\\nWhite House (and Democrats more broadly) would be wise to e.:;olain what ili niean for women if these\\ni •\\nnitiatives are gutted or lost—and to fight tooth and nail to make s-a•.e that doesn\\'t happen.\\nIf it doesn\\'t take these steps, the Democratic Party could lose ts grasr on a cr3-ni‘al.

The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatile\\nmixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how to\\nmitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.\\nThe bad news is that it\\'s too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and what\\nthe House actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn\\'t keep\\nAmericans employed. The \"Obama Doctrine\" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability to\\ncontribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector can\\'t meet the\\ndemand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, and\\nschools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century global\\neconomy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration to\\ntaxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30\\npoints of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, \"We don\\'t have a\\nshortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work.\" That message resonates across the political\\nspectrum. And it isn\\'t even the strongest message we\\'ve tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughest\\ndeficit-cutting language the other side can muster.\\nBut it\\'s too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on This\\nWeek several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually come\\ndown -- as if there\\'s nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measures\\nwhose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It\\'s hard to be excited by symbolism when your children\\nare hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn\\'t do anything to deserve it -- while the people who\\ndid are once again making out like bandits.\\nAlthough the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November, it ain\\'t over \\'til it\\'s over. Republicans are shooting\\nthemselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can\\'t see Middle\\nAmerica from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if they\\nunderstand the public mood and speak to it.\\nWhat is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.\\nOn the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment at\\nwhat could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in the\\nvast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and their\\nchildren\\'s future.\\nHow to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two Acts\\nSo how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.\\nAct I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth and\\nReconciliation without the Truth Part\\n• A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.\\nBy October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what\\'s happening\\nto their assets that they\\'re willing to give Democrats a chance.\\n• A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailout\\nwith no accountability. Unlike Republicans, who would say \"no\" in a situation like this and let a Great Recession\\nturn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don\\'t make it clear from the start that these\\nare Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcy\\nof Republican ideology.\\n• A charismatic young president raises people\\'s hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans are\\nfrightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to \"government is the problem, not the\\nsolution\" and a path back to economic recovery and security.\\n• The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.\\n• The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position that\\nwe should \"look forward, not backward,\" even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. As\\nconservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress or\\nPresident Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in five\\neither behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers who\\ngambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and to\\nrepeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn\\'t\\nsubside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -\\n- it\\'s how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush\\'s name in his\\nfirst year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton,\\nto co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn\\'t like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but if\\nforced to, he would cite unnamed \"naysayers,\" \"Washington politics as usual,\" or \"Congress,\" which was\\ncounterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in this\\nmessaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:\\n• The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essential\\nwhen the economy is spiraling downward. It\\'s not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the best\\neducators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, but\\nnever repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attacked\\nhim for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into office\\nbecause of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrifice\\nexcept our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations).\\nA year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, but\\nappeared defensive because it hadn\\'t been part of his guiding narrative from the start.\\n• The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and his\\nparty were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid branding\\nby conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.\\n• The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-\\nWashington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.\\nBut the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention to\\nstimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing what\\nthey learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting the\\nRepublicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert and\\nwarning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might be\\nneeded to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could start\\nreturning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House, the\\npresident chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent of\\nvoters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest point\\nfor the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.\\n• The economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don\\'t take the kind of\\ndramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful that\\nthis new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new \"stimulus\" act will do\\ncauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat, and\\nno one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was never\\nadequately crafted or sold.\\n• The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in the\\nfuture, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in the\\nexcesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people\\'s loyalty to the new\\npresident and Congress. (Heading into November, this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation the\\nDemocrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the president\\nnor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks that\\nreceived bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts but\\ndon\\'t seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury,\\nthe banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people\\'s existing credit\\ncard debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.\\n• Despite talk of accountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or even\\ninvestigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.\\nAct II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan\\n• The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don\\'t have health insurance at all,\\nand the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at the\\nsame time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1\\nmargin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it,\\nas evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb for\\nopponents of reform, who would do well to accept some major elements of it.\\n• But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devising\\nany new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to \"sell\" health care without a narrative. (I wrote about\\nthis in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses to\\nstate where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether we\\nshould have a \"public option\" (a term so ill-conceived it\\'s hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imagine\\nthe support it might have received if it had been called instead \"the one health care plan the health insurance\\ncompanies don\\'t get to control\"). Instead, the White House uses phrases such as \"bending the cost curve\" while\\nconservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as \"government takeover,\" \"a bureaucrat between\\nyou and your doctor,\" and \"death panels.\"\\n• Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which would\\nexplain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White House once again offers a story without\\nprotagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.\\n• Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare for\\nseniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut Social\\nSecurity despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the \"serial bribery\" of\\nRepublican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.\\n• At the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-like\\nalternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent of\\neven swing voters wanting it included in the bill.\\n• Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and that\\ngovernment can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that the\\nbetter plans they\\'ve negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are \"Cadillacs\" that are going to be\\ntaxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government can\\'t do anything\\nright and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the record\\nsupporting government or spending.\\n• \"Government\" hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts.\\n• Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the president\\'s job approval\\nwith swing voters drops into the high thirties.\\n• Following the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude that\\nwhen in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to \"reassure\"\\nthe public on health care that abortion won\\'t be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didn\\'t find that\\nreassuring), that domestic partners won\\'t be covered, and that immigrants won\\'t be covered. None of these issues\\nneeded to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressive\\npositions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)\\n• The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterly\\nconfused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. The\\npresident talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of families\\ntightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;\\npledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and \"clean coal\" (which doesn\\'t exist, by the way) in a\\nspeech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward for\\npassing \"No Latino Left Behind,\" while publicly objecting to the legislation.\\n• The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equal\\nparts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, and\\nincoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the center\\ndesperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why both\\nFDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn\\'t win any votes on the right.\\nBut it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized and\\nbetrayed (if they\\'re part of the \"professional left\") or less likely to vote (if they\\'re average voters who don\\'t follow\\npolitics carefully but just don\\'t feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they don\\'t really know why).\\n• Capping it all off, the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the \"drill here, drill now,\" \"all\\nof the above\" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfect\\nopportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety,\\nthe land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americans\\nagainst big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between what\\nhappened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)\\nand what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itself\\non the defensive, increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP, allowing BP to call the shots and control\\ninformation for weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, and issuing press releases that appear\\nindistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.\\nWhere Do We Go from Here?\\nSo that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely to\\nvote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; and\\na vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren\\'t\\ngoing well.\\nIn January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democrats\\nmight lose a few seats lost in an off-year election, but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the American\\npublic knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history, and the\\nAmerican people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in both\\nhouses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change was\\nnecessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.\\nBut there were red flags already by the end of Obama\\'s first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to the\\nnew administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you\\'ll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.\\nRe-brand government because there\\'s only one story out there now (Reagan\\'s), and it\\'s not one that supports a\\nprogressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads the\\npublic to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes, don\\'t throw\\nanother one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later, the White\\nHouse hasn\\'t consistently done any of these things, although the President is now intermittently doing some of them, and\\nwhen he does, he does them well.\\nThe question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in the\\ngame. The answer is that we\\'d better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs, including how to talk\\nabout deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats\\' Achilles Heel, particularly now -- there is little question that if\\nDemocrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative, values-driven,\\nand speak to people\\'s worries and \\'anger, many stand a good chance of surviving November, particularly when their\\nopponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals and\\nfiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplate\\nconservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And on\\nissue after issue, no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americans\\nand small business owners against special interests, big business, and their lobbyists.\\nBut actions speak louder than words, and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill we\\nshould have seen a year and a half ago, but it isn\\'t too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans -\\n- virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out of\\nwork by the Republicans\\' corporate sponsors. It isn\\'t too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popular\\naid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and police\\nall over the country with Republicans\\' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn\\'t too late to make a voting issue out of\\nthe bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked against\\nthem, and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses, which create 75 percent of the new jobs in this\\ncountry, and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoid\\npaying their fair share of American taxes. It\\'s not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to a\\nreasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It\\'s not too late to pass the\\nfirst badly need \"fix\" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say this\\nwas just the first step, namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent while\\ncutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent, which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were so\\nessential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It\\'s not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate to\\nprevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It\\'s not\\ntoo late to introduce legislation that\\'s been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections, so that the\\nvoice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.\\nOn every one of these issues, a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats need\\nto play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill, including those they expect the other side to block,\\nknowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrative\\nfrom what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- \"the Republicans won\\'t let us do it\" -- to a\\nnarrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice between\\ntwo well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides\\' positions and values.\\nThat leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what and\\nwho led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. That\\nnarrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike, rather than making each legislative issue a\\nseemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some key\\nelements: that if the economy is tumbling, it\\'s the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Street\\nis gambling with our financial security, our homes, and our jobs, true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquent\\naboUt the free market, they take away the dice; that if the private sector can\\'t create jobs for people who want to work,\\nthen we\\'ll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us from\\ncompeting with China\\'s wind and solar energy programs, then we\\'ll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctional\\ninvestments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safe\\nfuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.\\nThat\\'s what Democrats stand for. It\\'s time they said it.\\nDrew Westen, Ph.D., is Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Emory University, founder of Westen Strategies, and\\nauthor of The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.Lissa Muscatine <\\nFriday, August 20, 2010 11:09 AM\\nRe: Most importantly....\\nThanks for your nice words.

Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\\n1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway\\nYou have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects for\\npeace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi\\nArabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.\\nThe declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and\\nPalestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another\\ndeceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called \"peace process.\" And if that one step forward in Oslo in\\n1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.\\nThere can be no doubt about the importance of today\\'s topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs\\nthe world\\'s conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European\\ncolonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, by\\ndegrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It\\nstimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, the\\ninteraction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is\\nincreasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.\\nFor better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this\\ncontest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in\\nthe Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the Middle\\nEast thus affect much more than that region.\\nYet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involve\\nparties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel\\'s behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional\\nsupport for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a \"peace\\nprocess\" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are\\nalternatives to tomorrow\\'s diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role for\\npowers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.\\nOver thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt\\'s Anwar Sadat\\nhad opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian\\nleaders, setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally other\\ngovernments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but American power remains far greater than that of\\nany other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.\\nFor more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily and\\nto sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of\\ninternational law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning American\\nsupport has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the\\nPalestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have brought\\nsuccessive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.\\nIronically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a political\\nframework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation, pogroms, ethnic\\ncleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressive\\nconfinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.\\nDespite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine\\nremains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in the\\nregion — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union, having earlier laid the basis for\\nconflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China,\\nIndia, and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself, Iran has\\npostured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof.\\nOn rare occasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israel\\nwith action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.\\nsubventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to conclude\\narrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contempt\\nof the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part, Arab leaders have\\ntimorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them, while obsequiously courting American\\nprotection against Israel, each other, Iran, and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects and\\ncitizens.\\nIslam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embody\\nrighteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites\\' failure to meet these standards\\ngenerates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governments\\nassociated with it.\\nThe perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for American\\ncomplicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington\\'s protection\\nof Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington\\'s response to the attack\\nincluded suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and\\nIraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. The\\narmed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other\\ncountries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They are\\nechoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United States,\\nThe widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed a\\nmetastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world\\'s 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as a\\nmenace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal security. American populists and European\\nxenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers\\nterrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoted\\ndemagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent\\nillustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. It\\nrules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.\\nPresident Obama\\'s inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came into\\noffice committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the international\\nmedia was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkish\\nparliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably\\neloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injustices\\nin the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious\\nrecrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama\\'s sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policy\\nchange anyone can detect, let alone believe in\\nIt is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration\\'s\\nstewardship of so many aspects of my country\\'s affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two\\nmonths from tomorrow, on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas is\\nonly part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in\\nthe situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.\\nLet me begin with the \"peace process,\" a hardy perennial of America\\'s diplomatic repertoire that the Obama\\nAdministration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and \"even-\\nhanded\" American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. It\\nprovided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to\\nstand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and the\\nArabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, there\\nhasn\\'t been an American-led \"peace process\" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a \"peace\\nprocess\" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the \"peace\\nprocess\" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.\\nEven when there was no \"peace process,\" the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible, cover to the\\nguileful, beguilement for the press, an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and — last but far\\nfrom least — lifetime employment for career \"peace processors.\" The perpetual processing of peace without the\\nrequirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like\\nmagicians, riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their\\nhomes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories, and annexed a widening\\nswath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.\\nPalestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a \"peace process.\" It\\'s\\nnot just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people\\'s suffering. Playing \"peace process\" charades\\njustifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupied\\nterritories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for American\\nleaders, engagement in some sort of Middle East \"peace process\" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamic\\nworlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews are\\nimpatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of the\\ngovernment of Israel to trade land for it.\\nPrevious \"peace processes\" have exploited all these impulses. In practice, however, these diplomatic distractions have\\nserved to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving\\nit. Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history, it has taken a year and a half of\\nrelentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as\\nthey first did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washington\\ntomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.\\nOne is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed\\n\"peace processes\" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-\\nprepared meeting, at Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, their political\\nauthority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize President\\nObama\\'s political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda — still\\nless to address each other\\'s agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final\\n— iteration of the perpetually ineffectual \"peace process\" are more fundamental.\\nThe Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulates\\nthat: \"The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign\\nstate.\" This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It has\\nno interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound\\nby the applicable UN resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the \"Roadmap,\" or the premise of the \"two-state\\nsolution.\"\\nThe Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But the\\nauthority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on their\\nstanding in the occupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its\\nauthority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains\\npower by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the government empowered\\nby the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas\\'s constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over\\na parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he, his faction, or his\\nadministration can now speak.\\nSo the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating with\\nthe mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international\\ncredibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU, Russia,\\nand the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who was\\npublicly humiliated by Israel\\'s prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel\\'s\\ncontinuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.\\nVague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the \"peace process\" has always\\nsneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year\\nwas made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resulted\\nfrom previous meetings over the decades, beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will\\nrecall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if the\\ninternational community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian\\nstate. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.\\nPeace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible to\\nimpose. It cannot become a reality, still less be sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality\\ndirects our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems these\\nabsences create.\\nObviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — Hamas\\n— is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they\\nhave nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements were\\nexplicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly\\nfinessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcile\\neither American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be\\nrepresented in Washington only in tenuous theory, not in fact.\\nOther Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks\\ntomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest\\ninstallment of the \"peace process\" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and\\nalso a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way the\\nUnited States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definition\\nevidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and\\nAmericans.\\nTo begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new \"peace process\" have officially acknowledged or\\nresponded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel\\nmake peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer,\\nignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.\\nIn this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel\\'s \"right to exist\" the central purpose of the \"peace process\" offends\\nArabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well\\nbeyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem\\nto be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and\\nthe manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and\\naccept peace?\\nArabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a\\nhomeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of\\nPalestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking\\nthem to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they\\nrecognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel\\'s unilateral\\nexpansion at Palestinian expense.\\nThe lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns\\nabout Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S.\\npeace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of\\nacceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.\\nEach time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met with\\nincredulity. To most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washington\\'s sympathy and solicitude for Israelis\\nand its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement\\nof Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a \"peace process\" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of\\ncarrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.\\nThe effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously\\nunpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of\\nGeorge Mitchell\\'s mandate for \"peace process\" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposed\\nfollow-up to tomorrow\\'s meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other\\nArabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.\\nAs a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic\\nhas two quite different words that are both translated as \"negotiation,\" making a distinction that doesn\\'t exist in either\\nEnglish or Hebrew. One word, \"musaawama,\" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in\\nbazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each\\nother. Another, \"mufaawadhat,\" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that\\ntake place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.\\nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat\\'s travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of\\nmufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It\\ncalled for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded with\\nintermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on\\nwhich a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.\\nI cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomatic\\neffectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands\\nthings and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the\\nreasons we can\\'t seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don\\'t make much effort to understand\\nhow others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are\\nlong on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essential\\nmilitarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have\\nforgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.\\nI am not myself an \"Arabist,\" but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the\\nAmerican diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and\\nempathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw\\nas in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our\\nMiddle East diplomacy.\\nThis brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for\\nwhat must be done.\\nIn foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeed\\nEuropeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include -\\nbut are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the gross\\ninjustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as\\nfriendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival of\\nanti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to\\nthe Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.\\nArab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determination\\nfor Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel\\'s democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest\\nin ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensions\\nwith the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as\\nthey very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia\\'s King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogue\\nand the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.\\nAs the custodian of two of Islam\\'s three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has long\\ntranscended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all\\nsects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of\\nreligious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure\\nfreedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest\\nthat Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.\\nThere is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is\\ngenerally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects\\npathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow\\'s meeting\\nmay well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the\\nachievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone else\\'s that\\nothers become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not\\nexpecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.\\nHere, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was\\nhappy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them\\nfrom subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protected\\nfrom Israel\\'s ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.\\nThis brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most\\nAmericans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending\\nthe stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to\\npresent today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the\\nArabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint\\nor parallel action on behalf of peace.\\nNow to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial.\\nFirst, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted\\nthan most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have\\npublished some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its\\ncontents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab\\nLeague declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of the\\nArab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation\\nwith them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab\\nMuslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn\\'t be bad for Europe\\'s relations with\\nboth. By the way, given the U.S. media\\'s notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a\\nwell-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.\\nSecond, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who\\nare empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so\\nas to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace\\npartner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has\\nacted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity\\ngovernment to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strong\\ndomestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some\\ncircumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.\\nThird, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of law\\ninternationally. In the case of the Middle East, however, the Council\\'s position at the apex of the international system has\\nserved to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have prevented\\nthe application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rights\\nconventions, and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced the\\ncollective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied\\nterritory, administered collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders, massacred civilians,\\nbarred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior,\\nusually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.\\nIf ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, and the like are not just \"unhelpful\" but illegal, the international community should\\nfind a way to say so, even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -\\nits vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles, all exempt\\nthemselves, and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel, both\\nas occupier and as regional military hegemon, is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN General\\nAssembly cannot \"unite for peace\" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states should not shrink\\nfrom working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyond\\nneed to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced, there will be a better\\nchance for peace.\\nFourth, set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UN\\nSecurity Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference\\noutside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement in\\na year, one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference\\nwould consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel\\'s 1967\\nborders or recognition of Israel\\'s achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring\\nIsrael to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions, boycott, and\\ndisinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face the\\nconsequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of the\\ninternational community. Admittedly, any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomatic\\nconfrontation with the United States as well as Israel, despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-\\nyear deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow\\'s talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit\\nimmensely from peace with the Palestinians.\\nTime is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlement\\nactivity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so, it will not be local or regional, but global in its reach. Israel\\'s\\nactions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who are\\ndetermined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to\\nalleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage\\nagainst injustice that incites terrorism.\\nIt is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation\\nbetween Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked\\nto set the stage for a discussion of this issue.Ebeling, Betsy\\nThursday, September 2, 2010 2:38 PM\\nH\\nYou look beautiful!!!!\\nole0.bmp; ole0.bmpGotta love himPIR <preines\\nThursday, September 2, 2010 6:33 PM\\nH\\nCDM; Huma Abedin; Lona Valmoro; Jake Sullivan\\nJoint Interview\\nMS —\\nJake just relayed yoLir desire to cancel tomorrow\\'s interview.

Sid\\nSeptember 3, 2010\\nAmericans Most Likely to Favor GOP\\nNewcomers for Congress\\nThree in four believe influx of new members would improve\\nCongress\\nby Jeffrey M. Jones\\nPRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice of\\nfour hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer \"a\\nRepublican who has not served in Congress.\" Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent over\\na newcomer.\\nThese results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment for\\nRepublicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a Republican\\ncandidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardless\\nof party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%.\\nThe fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voters\\nwant both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washington\\nexperience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the type\\nof experienced representatives now in Congress.\\nOne would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and Republicans to prefer Republican\\ncandidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans\\' preferences for incumbents versus\\nchallengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus,\\nmore Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is in\\nCongress to a Democrat who is not, and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to one\\nwho is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents.\\nThe data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specific\\ncandidates for Congress. This fall, voters will generally be asked to choose between one Republican and one Democratic\\ncandidate, one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for the\\nRepublican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today, 48% of Americans\\nsay the Republican and 43% the Democrat.\\nThe appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congress\\nwould be changed for the better if \"most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members.\" Only 14%\\nthink that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup\\'s findings from earlier this year suggesting strong\\nanti-incumbent sentiment.\\nAmericans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most members\\nwere turned out of office. However, there is a significant gap by political party, with 89% of Republicans versus 63% of\\nDemocrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again, the difference likely stems from\\nDemocrats\\' current status as the majority party in Congress.\\nImplications\\nIn a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president and\\nCongress, it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected in\\nAmericans\\' preference for a Republican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for in\\nthis fall\\'s midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greater\\nseat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular.Slaughter, Anne-Marie <SlaughterA@state.gov>\\nFriday, September 17, 2010 6:28 PM\\nAbedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob J\\nA moratorium by any other name....\\nI hope you get a true break this weekend; you certainly deserve it.

We cd take on the critics directly and right up front and\\nmake the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro, but wd need to be pulled together differently).\\n1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that require\\nbringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is the\\nonly option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing a\\nprofile - it resonated v well w/ landler.)\\n2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be brought\\ntogether that do not trust each other, we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nations\\nare sitting around the table contemplating a common problem, someone has to step forward and take responsibility for\\nmobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that, both because of our\\nhistory and our values. (Here is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in a\\nworld of global problems, we are the most global nation, with the greatest global reach, resources, and connections.\\n3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity, b/c of our native confidence,\\noptimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda, focusing on\\ndevelopment as well as traditional national security issues, and mobilizing business and civil society as well as\\ngovernments. This is our time.\\nThe speech would then go on, as it does now, to outline all the ways in which we are building relationships and solving\\nproblems now with traditional allies and new powers on the global landscape while building a longer term architecture\\nof cooperation that is both truly global and adapted to solving 21st century problems.\\nAMWe are working to incorporate some of the missing links but I haven\\'t gotten any comments from anyone.

Jones\\nPRINCETON, NJ -- A new USA Today/Gallup poll finds Americans saying the Republicans in Congress would do a better\\njob than the Democrats in Congress of handling seven of nine key election issues. The parties are essentially tied on\\nhealthcare, with the environment being the lone Democratic stren th.\\nThe Republicans\\' advantage on most issues is an indication of the currently favorable political environment for the party.\\nOf particular note is the parity between the two parties on healthcare, an issue on which Americans historically have\\nviewed the Democrats as superior.\\nA similar USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in October 2006, just prior to Democrats\\' major gains in that fall\\'s elections,\\nhighlights the potential implications of these findings. That poll, which includes several issues measured in the current\\nsurvey, found the Democrats leading on all eight issues tested at that time, including some usual Republican strengths\\nlike terrorism and moral values.\\nWith Republicans now having the advantage on most issues, the party may be poised to make major gains in\\ncongressional seats, just as the Democrats did in 2006. Indeed, Gallup tracking of registered voters\\' preferences in the\\n2010 generic ballot for Congress continues to find the Republicans ahead of the Democrats, as it has for the past five\\nweeks.\\nThe Economy Matters Most\\nThe Democrats\\' advantage on the issue of the environment is likely not something the party can leverage to improve its\\n2010 electoral fortunes, as Americans rank it at the bottom of the list in terms of its importance to their vote. Rather,\\neconomic concerns are paramount, with a majority of Americans rating the economy, jobs, and federal spending (along\\nwith government corruption) as extremely important.\\nThe Republican advantages on these economic matters range from a low of +5 on jobs to a high of +15 on federal\\nspending. Terrorism -- the issue on which Republicans have the greatest advantage over Democrats -- is rated as very\\nimportant by 47% of Americans, putting it in the middle of the list.\\nBottom Line\\nRepublicans\\' perceptual advantage on most key election issues reinforces the party\\'s advantageous positioning heading\\ninto the stretch run of the 2010 election campaign. It is not clear whether Americans give the Republicans the edge on\\nthese issues because they have confidence in the GOP to make progress in addressing the major problems facing the\\ncountry, or whether the ratings have more to do with the public\\'s frustration with the incumbent Democratic Party\\'s\\nperformance to date.\\nThe Democrats\\' hopes for improving their fortunes may hinge on convincing voters they have superior plans for jump-\\nstarting the economy, the issue of uppermost importance in Americans\\' minds. That could be tough to do when, after\\nnearly 20 months of Democratic leadership in Congress and the White House, Americans\\' opinions of the economy\\nremain negative and have become more pessimistic in recent weeks.Wherever you are. What a great note to start your vacation on. Lissa and I had a great conversation w/ Jake tonight; the\\nargument is becoming clearer and clearer. I am leery of promises, but we are aiming for another draft to you before\\nnoon on Sunday.\\nHave fun!\\nAMSullivan, Jacob J <Sullivann@state.gov>\\nFriday, September 17, 2010 10:21 PM\\nSlaughter, Anne-Marie; H\\nAbedin, Huma\\nRe: A moratorium by any other name....Financial Times FT.com\\nPolitics & Foreign policy\\nClinton\\'s aim is true as Democrats\\' top gun\\nBy Edward Luce in Washington\\nPublished: October 12 2010 20:43 I Last updated: October 12 2010 20:43\\nNobody would go so far as to call it a comeback. But Bill Clinton\\'s appearances on the midterm election trail are starting to\\nturn voters\\' heads in a way that Barack Obama\\'s simply are not.\\nDemocratic operatives say that Mr Clinton, who went through in 1994 the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr Obama will\\nface in less than three weeks, is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly different\\nalternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the Obama administration.\\nSo far the president, who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning, has been unable to pull that off. This\\nweek alone, Mr Clinton has shaken up two Senate races — in Kentucky and West Virginia — with appearances that have\\nassisted Democratic candidates. Mr Clinton was due to speak in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to assist the embattled\\nHarry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and then move onto California later in the week.\\n\"Bill Clinton is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got,\" says Norm Ornstein, a political analyst\\nat the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"He has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobody\\nelse can do right now.\" Mr Clinton\\'s intervention in Kentucky, where Jack Conway, the Democratic candidate, is locked in\\na tight race with Rand Paul, the Tea Party icon, is a good case in point.\\nAt the weekend Mr Clinton described Mr Paul, who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government and\\nhas talked of abolishing the Federal Reserve, as a \"radical with no record to back it up\". Mr Paul, who has never run for\\nelected office, hit back by reminding voters of Mr Clinton\\'s former Monica Lewinsky scandal. \"I am not sure I would trust a\\nman who had sex with an intern,\" said Mr Paul. \"I mean, do you think he\\'s an honourable person?\"\\nMr Paul\\'s trip down memory lane appears to have backfired. Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal that\\noccurred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets, job creation and the absence of foreign\\nwars.\\n\"Bill Clinton\\'s strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity into advantage,\" says Tad Devine, a veteran\\nDemocratic operative. \"He is also able to enter an individual race, take the temperature, understand what people are\\nfeeling and then base his appeal to voters on that.\"\\nIn the West Virginia Senate race, where Joe Manchin, the governor, is trailing John Raese, a wealthy local businessman,\\nMr Clinton on Monday came out punching. Referring to Mr Raese\\'s plush Florida vacation home, the former president\\nsaid: \"I\\'m here for a lot of reasons. One is that I don\\'t think it\\'s fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida to\\nhave three.\"\\nAcknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr Obama has 29 per cent rating, among the lowest in the country, Mr\\nClinton added: \\'I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad — and I am not just talking about\\npolitics here — there is about an 80 per cent chance you will make a mistake.\"\\nIn contrast, a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr Obama has framed the midterm campaign, shifting from one\\nattack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative. Last month, Mr Obama turned on John Boehner, the\\nRepublican congressional leader, in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters\\' alternative.\\nMore recently, Mr Obama has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money into\\nattack ads. But it has generated a lot of criticism. \"This election is awash with undisclosed money and it\\'s fair to point out\\nhow disadvantaged the Democrats have been,\" says one consultant. \"But it isn\\'t good politics at this late stage when\\nvoters clearly want to hear about the economy.\"\\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

This is both the right thing to do and getting good\\npress where it counts. AM\\nDear Friends and Colleagues:\\nWhat if we told you a little-known bureaucratic process called \"Implementation and Procurement Reform,\"\\nIPR for short, was one of the biggest victories for poor people in years? It means more aid can go directly\\nthrough a country\\'s own systems, making them stronger. It also means that more aid will be administered\\nby local organizations who know best what their own communities need.\\nThrough IPR, USAID is putting President Obama\\'s recent global development policy into action. The agency\\nhas set clear targets to increase use of local country systems and organizations, which means that US\\nassistance will help citizens and their governments build their own capacity, instead of setting up a parallel\\nsystem as they\\'ve done in recent years. They\\'ve set clear and ambitious targets for themselves that are\\nlaser-focused on results, and dedicated to fighting global poverty not just in the short term, but for good.\\nPhoto: Local organizations distribute assistance after performing a needs assessment in Bihar, India.\\nIan Bray/OXFAM GB\\nThis reform will likely be criticized by some who think that putting more money in the hands of local actors\\nwill expose USAID\\'s programs to more risk. But this is precisely the point; only by supporting local change\\nagents—both inside and outside developing country governments—can we actually strengthen the hands of\\npeople in poor countries who are working to change their own societies for the better. That means managing\\nrisk wisely, rather than trying to avoid it altogether. And in our field research, 36 of the 39 activists we\\ninterviewed said they want USAID to support their government\\'s directly, because it would make it easier for\\nthem to hold their governments accountable and prevent corruption.\\nWhat does all this mean? It means better aid, aid that strengthens the capacity of reformers in poor countries.\\nAnd for the millions of people across the world who have been demanding these reforms, USAID has shown\\nit is actively listening.\\nSincerely,\\nThe Aid Effectiveness Team\\np.s.

Besides\\nproviding a forum for debating European politics, the symposium was the occasion for the first public appearance in\\nEurope by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature last month. The arrival\\nof Vargas Llosa, one of the world\\'s foremost intellectuals, resulted in an overflow crowd filled with members of the Dutch\\nmedia, the country\\'s political class, and the royal family.\\nEven with Vargas Llosa in the spotlight, the participants\\' attention was focused on Geert Wilders, the leader of the far-right\\nDutch People\\'s Party for Freedom and Democracy, which is now the third leading party in the Netherlands. With his\\ngathering influence, Wilders has essentially placed the Dutch coalition government in a stranglehold; the government\\nmeets with him every Wednesday to gauge his opinions and ask for his instructions. While Wilders dictates at will to the\\ngovernment, he remains independent of it, comfortably avoiding the consequences of policies he has helped to shape. It\\nis the perfect position for a politician whose agenda is comprised exclusively of xenophobic populism, and typical strategy\\nof the far-right in countries across the continent.\\nWilders\\' base lies in the mostly Catholic south, where ironically few people have ever encountered a Muslim. He has also\\ngenerated support in the city of Groeningen, once a citadel of the communists. Seeking to expand his base, Wilders\\npromised to hire scores of \"animal cops\" to investigate and prosecute the abuse of animals, a clever wedge strategy in the\\nonly country I know of that has a party dedicated exclusively to animal rights. Of course, Wilders could care less about our\\nfurry friends. His stated goal is to end immigration not just to Holland but to all of Europe; ban the Quran (free speech is\\nonly for the \"Judeo-Christian\" community), and severely limit the rights of Muslim citizens of Europe by, for instance,\\ninstituting what he called a \"head rag tax\" on Muslim women. Wilders\\' international allies include the goosestepping neo-\\nNazis of the English Defense League, the far-right pogromist Pam Geller, the Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belang,\\nand a substantial portion of the US neocon elite. Over the course of just a few years, he has become perhaps the most\\ninfluential Islamophobe in the world.\\nBut does this make Wilders a fascist? Rob Riemen, the director of the Nexus Institute, thinks so. Riemen has just\\npublished a book entitled \"De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme,\" or \"The Eternal Return of Fascism\" (I eagerly await\\nits English translation), dedicated to highlighting the danger of Wilders\\' eerily familiar brand of right-wing populism. In the\\nbook, Riemen urges readers to compare Wilders\\' politics to the early incarnations of European fascism, not to the\\ngenocidal terminal stage fascism of late World War II. He calls the parallels between Wilders and the early fascists \"one-\\nand-one.\" In an economic and civilizational crisis like the kind the Netherlands is facing, Riemen warns that reactionary\\nfigures like Wilders can easily seize power while centrist elements stand by politely and passively, refusing to call a spade\\na spade. Where Wilders\\' ascendancy will lead is unknown, but if he is not stopped in his tracks, Riemen is certain the\\nB6\\nstory will not end well. In the week after its publication, Riemen\\'s book flew off the shelves, selling 5000 copies while\\ngenerating heated reactions from across the spectrum of debate.\\nRiemen told me that despite the public enthusiasm for his book, his characterization of Wilders has been attacked as \"un-\\nDutch.\" In Dutch culture, as in so many others, open confrontation is avoided at all cost. Political disagreement is\\nwelcomed only if it is expressed in a collegial manner, as though nothing more than reputations were at stake. So the\\nDutch cultural elite generally goes along to get along. The resistance Riemen has met since he called Wilders out seemed\\nto have alarmed and frustrated him. Why was it so difficult for liberal elements in the Netherlands to recognize the clear\\nresonances of fascism in Wilders\\' political style? he wondered. And why did they seem more concerned with regulating\\nthe terms of debate than with forming a united front against the far-right? Once the symposium opened and I was able to\\nsee the Dutch elite in action, I began to understand Riemen\\'s indignation.\\nThe symposium began with a speech by Vargas Llosa, a complex personality who has allied himself with center-right\\nparties in Spain and elsewhere but whose politics remain fundamentally rooted in cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa\\'s\\ndifferences with leaders of the left, which he used to belong to, exploded over the issue of free trade. He is an ardent neo-\\nliberal and reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez and 011anta Humala who advocate protectionism and industrial\\nnationalization.\\nVargas Llosa decorated his speech with literary metaphors and natural imagery to describe the challenges of democracy,\\nparticularly in Europe. But the body of the address was devoted to the supposed threat Islamic extremism posed to\\nWestern civilization. Vargas Llosa singled out suicide bombing as the most dangerous phenomenon, pointing to the\\nMadrid and London bombings by al-Qaida inspired operatives, while curiously not mentioning suicide attacks by secular\\ngroups like the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK, or the nationalistic suicide terror by Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosa\\ndeclared in his speech that \"Israel deserves to be treated like any other nation,\" and has been harshly critical of the state\\nin the past).\\nDuring the first panel, which I participated in, Fania Oz-Salzberger, an Israeli professor of history and the daughter of\\nfamed author Amos Oz, boasted to crowd of Israel\\'s \"vibrant democracy.\" She was enthusiastically seconded by Mitchell\\nCohen, a former editor of Dissent who has devoted considerable energy to assailing anti-Zionist Jews, writing that \"the\\ndominant species of anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism.\" I found it odd that neither expressed any concern over the\\nalmost endless stream of anti-democratic laws passing through the Knesset, or by the general authoritarian, anti-liberal\\ntrend in Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went on to announce to a smattering of applause that \"Geert Wilders and politicians\\nlike him are not welcomed by Israelis.\"\\nYet Wilders is one of Israel\\'s most frequent guests, having visited the country over 40 times in 20 years. In fact, he claims\\nthat his views on Islam and Arabs were forged while living on an Israeli moshav. \"Nowhere did I have the special feeling of\\nsolidarity that I get when I land at Ben Gurion airport,\" he once said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support from Dutch\\nfinancial backers of Israel, and has met with a range of Israeli officials. His closest allies lie within the extremist settler\\nmovement, prompting him to call for the forced transfer of Palestinians to Jordan. Members of the liberal Zionist\\nintelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may not not want Wilders around, but who in Israel is listening to them? Israel\\'s\\nmainstream leadership echoes Wilders\\' crudest talking points on a regular basis, while the Zionist left clings to a dwindling\\nhandful of Knesset seats and watches passively — even resentfully — as a rag-tag band of leftist radicals fights for\\nequality for all. Consider a recent statement by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is seen as a centrist within the\\nIsraeli political spectrum: \"The origin of terrorism is within Islam,\" Olmert declared this month.\\nThe pro-Israel position of the new breed of European far-rightists has to be recognized as much more than a convenient\\npolitical tactic. Of course, saying you \"stand with Israel,\" as Wilders so often does, is an easy way to insulate yourself from\\ncharges of anti-Semitism. But the extreme right is also attracted to Israel because the country represents its highest\\nideals. While some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see Israel as a racist apartheid state\\n— and they like it. They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells the world to go to hell;\\nthey admire Israel\\'s settler culture; and most of all, they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges its ethnic majority\\nabove all others to the point that it systematically humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass. The endgame\\nof the far-right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli.\\nAfter the Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D\\'Arcais proclaimed that Italy was no longer a democratic country, citing PM\\nSilvio Berlusconi\\'s control over 90 percent of the country\\'s media, the government\\'s deep seated corruption and the Prime\\nMinister\\'s repeated attempts to impose onerous restrictions on journalistic freedom, Riemen asked me if the United States\\nwas a democracy given the the rapidly rising influence of corporations over the media and elections. After two panelists\\nhad described Israel as a vibrant democracy while another labeled Italy a non-democratic quasi-dictatorship, I decided\\nthat our definition of democracy was subjective at best. So I sidestepped the question and outlined a few of the greatest\\nblows to American democracy, from the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine to the Telecommunications Deregulation Act\\nto the Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later in the evening, D\\'Arcais would remark to me with amazement that he\\nnever knew American media was ever regulated in the first place.\\nDuring the 20 minutes or so when students of Tilburg University were able to question the panel, one student asked\\nwhether suicide terror was a uniquely Islamic phenomenon, apparently referring to Vargas Llosa\\'s address. I responded\\nthat it of course was not, citing the example of secular groups like the Tamil Tigers which brought the tactic into practice\\nthe second suicide. I recommended the audience review the research of Robert Pape, the University of Chicago political\\nscientist who demonstrated a clear connection between the American and Israeli occupation of Middle Eastern countries\\nand the motivations of suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in, proclaiming that occupation has little or nothing to do\\nwith the motives of suicide bombers. She did not marshal any evidence to support her point, possibly because our time\\nwas so limited. It would have been hard to do so, however, without supporting the fundamental argument of Wilders about\\nIslam\\'s inherent violence — or the even sillier theory by the Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov that\\nsuicide bombers are motivated by sexual repression.\\nNext, the Dutch panel took the stage. The main attraction was Frits Bolkstein, the longtime leader of the People\\'s Party for\\nFreedom and Democracy who employed Wilders as his parliamentary aide, providing him a stepping stone to his political\\ncareer. He was a silver haired curmudgeon from aristocratic stock who reminded me instantly of the \"paleocon\" characters\\nI\\'ve met while covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance.\\n\"Everything went wrong when the government became impressed in the 90\\'s with the idea of the \\'good stranger,\"\\nBolkstein declared. \"If the previous governments had tightened their immigration laws, there would not have been a Mr.\\nWilders.\"\\nThe only member of the panel to mount a significant challenge to Bolkstein was the Tilburg University professor Paul\\nFrissen, who argued that the rule of law and basic standards of democracy protects \"the right to be fundamentalist.\" The\\nother panelists either gave Bolkstein\\'s xenophobia a pass or attempted to surpass his resentment of Muslims. After\\nBolkstein lightly criticized Wilders\\' call for banning the Quran, remarking that \"what he says about Islam is nonsense\"\\nbecause it contradicts the freedom of religion, AB Klink, a former Dutch senator and ex-Minister of Health, chimed in.\"It\\'s\\nnot nonsense because Islam is so different in its cultural values than ours,\" Klink claimed.\\nThen, when Bolkstein called for shutting down Islamic schools, Frissen reminded him that state-supported Christian\\nschools in the Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts as well. Meindert Fennema, the political biographer of Wilders,\\nentered the debate to demand that all religious schools be closed. \"I\\'m against all forms of religious teaching!\" he proudly\\nexclaimed, sending gales of applause through the audience. \"How can you call yourself a liberal?\" Frissen asked with a\\ntone of exasperation. Fennema ignored him.\\nDuring question time, a young freelance writer from India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein to answer for the\\n\"ghost of neo-colonialism,\" which \"the African people never voted for.\" She mentioned the exploitative deals forced on\\ndeveloping countries by transnational oil companies, possibly alluding to Bolkstein\\'s role as a manager at Royal Dutch\\nShell in authoritarian countries like El Salvador, Indonesia, and Honduras during the 1970\\'s (I\\'m sure nothing unseemly\\nhappened during Bo!stein\\'s tenure in these places). Bolkstein\\'s responded bluntly, \"If these countries try to be self-\\nsufficient it just doesn\\'t work!\"\\nAfter the symposium, I talked to Ginwala and a group of her friends, who were mostly immigrant students. They were\\nappalled by the ignorance of the Dutch panelists. \"None of them knew the first thing about Islam,\" an Arab student\\nremarked. \"They couldn\\'t even pretend to understand what Muslims actually believe.\" Ginwala added, \"How can Bolkstein\\ntell me my country can\\'t be self-sufficient? I come from India. It\\'s one of the most diversified economies on the planet.\"\\nI was not in Amsterdam long enough to do any formal reporting. However, I did notice that all of the immigrants I spoke to\\nwere closely and nervously following the rise of the right. At the airport, while waiting to board my flight, I talked to a 20-\\nsomething security guard named Muhammad who seemed almost as bored as I was. Muhammad had spent his whole life\\nin Amsterdam, but his parents were from Cairo, Egypt. He told me he wanted to take his girlfriend on a trip to New York\\nCity and Miami someday. When I brought up the topic of Wilders, he scoffed at his perception of Muslims. \"Most of us\\naren\\'t even religious,\" Muhammad said. \"When I hear him talking about Muslims wanting to take over, I just laugh. I\\'m like,\\nis this guy serious?\"\\nBut he did not underestimate Wilders\\' appeal. \"Everything he does and everything he says, it seems like it\\'s carefully\\nplanned. He obviously knows what he\\'s doing. And they let him get away with it,\" Muhammad remarked. \"Look, I\\'m just a\\ncitizen, I\\'m nobody, but if I say something about Christians or Jews that the government doesn\\'t like, I\\'ll be punished. But\\nwhen Wilders, who is a public official, says all the things he says about Muslims, nothing happens to him. Instead, more\\nand more people are voting for him.\"Ms,\\nMashabane is no longer available this morning, but can do anytime btw 6-8 am tomorrow morning.

Huck was the first wife and mother elected to Congress. Republican Ruth Hanna\\nMcCormick worked as a Springfield lobbyist who helped pass the law allowing Illinois women to vote\\nin some elections in 1913 before she moved on to Congress.

It is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on Arab\\nand — a 50 per cent rise — took place in 1992-96 under the governments of peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon\\nPeres at.the high-water mark of the Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir Arafat,\\nwho wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was the\\noccupation. The second intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.\\nA decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank into a discontiguous scattering of\\ncantons, walled in by a security barrier built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli roads\\nlinking the settlements. Last month, B\\'Tselem, the Israeli human rights group, published a study showing Israel has now\\ntaken 42 per cent of the West Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The siege of\\nGaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison.\\nThe main feature of the present situationi is the disconnect between the high politics of the utterly discredited peace\\nprocess and these — in Israeli parlance — \"facts on the ground\".\\nAt last month\\'s White House summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu massaged their long estrangement\\ninto a political armistice, the US president praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader \"willing to take risks for peace\".\\nBut there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in June last year, in response to Mr Obama\\'s Cairo speech denying\\nany legitimacy to Israel\\'s settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words \"Palestinian state\" — but he\\nsurrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.\\nIndeed, the words all sides use — peace, resolution, security, and so on — may be the same; but what each side means by\\nthem is different.\\nThe mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salem Fayyad, the prime minister, and the Quartet\\nmade up of the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states living\\nin peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967\\nArab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps to\\npreserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu mean?\\nHe has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his face against any concessions on\\nJerusalem. He wants to keep most settlements except for the far-flung \"ideological\" ones and the 100-plus \"outposts\"\\nestablished as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a demilitarised Palestinian state is more like a\\nsort of supra-municipal administration than a self-determined, independent government.\\nWill he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is politicians of the right who most easily\\nclose difficult deals? There is little to suggest that:\\nThe thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel, has always been profoundly irredentist.\\nWhile his nationalist Likud faces the constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and ultra-orthodox\\nparties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To be\\nfair, Israel\\'s electoral system — with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes multi-party coalitions inevitable —\\nmeans lobbies such as the settlers can take the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choice\\nof partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in the US.\\nAs risks he. has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on settlement-building, which expires next\\nmonth and has, in any case, been speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been idling,\\nmoreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been roaring: the rate of demolition in and around\\nJerusalem has doubled this year, while the army has just razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley, in line with\\nMr Netanyahu\\'s strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the valley as Israel\\'s eastern border.\\nAs diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution, three rival systems of control have crystallised in\\nthe occupied territories that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped Palestinian\\nAuthority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas, which Israel and its Arab and western allies have tried and failed\\nto marginalise. Time is short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.\\nThe outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and Arab Peace initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22\\nArab and 57 Muslim countries (as well as Hamas, as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to the\\noccupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand it.\\nThe writer is international affairs editor\\n\"FT\" and \"Financial Times\" are trademarks of the Financial Times.

He is the author of \"Israel and the Bomb\" and the forthcoming \"The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel\\'s\\nBargain with the Bomb.\"\\nAvner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now,\\nand why would that be good for Israel?\\n\"Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of a\\ncomprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not just\\nanachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an \\'own goal\\' for Israel. In my view, it\\nundermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the\\nresponsible states in this strategic field.\"\\nAre you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usually\\nmarginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. •\\n\"Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state\\'\\nsurrounded by enemies, and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh. Israel\\'s image was different then.\\n\"In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more it\\nwill be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the\\nnuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you don\\'t have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be.\"\\nThe United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister Benjamin\\nNetanyahu\\'s visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the\\nthreats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures.\\nThe Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to look\\nas though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I don\\'t\\nbelieve this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis.\"\\nDo you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands\\nthat Israel disarm?\\n\"Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody \\'demands that Israel make such an announcement without\\nfirst doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israel\\nhas its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things.\"\\nWhat about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race\\nagainst Israel?\\n\"I don\\'t dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would be\\nprepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as though\\nthey were children: If they are told that Israel doesn\\'t admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. I\\nbelieve the Arab countries don\\'t want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly and\\nrealistically.\"\\nYou say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israel\\'s nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel\\nsupporters.\\n\"But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It can\\neven remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle.\\n\"If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The international\\ncommunity thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclear\\nweapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the less\\npatience the world will have for Israel.\"\\nHow do you envision the scenario of \\'coming out of the nuclear closet?\\'\\n\"Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it is\\nvery hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didn\\'t exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more\\nopenly.\\n\"Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but there\\nis no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation.\\n\"On the international level, it\\'s a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement by\\nIsrael\\'s government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. He would talk\\nabout the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, these\\nweapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I don\\'t think Israel would need to go into detail\\nregarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has.\\n\"Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we are\\nsinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can\\'t tell the awful truth - and I don\\'t think it is so awful. This\\nis a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say something\\npositive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic...\\n\"All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.\\nWhether that will happen in our lifetimes I can\\'t say.\"\\nYou say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as the\\nquestion of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion?\\n\"There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an\\nunacceptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguity\\'s power derives from the fact that Israeli society\\naccepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security.\\n\"Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be\\nhandled by \\'trustworthy hands\\' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself.\\nAmbiguity has created an ignorant, craven public.which, in a certain sense, has betrayed its civic, democratic duties on\\nthis subject.\"\\nWhat\\'s it like researching a topic nobody discusses?\\n\"When I started studying this subject 25 years ago, I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could be\\ntouched. It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly - from a researcher\\'s perspective, not from\\nthe standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter.\\nToday I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete, real issues.\"\\n• Print Page\\n• Send to a friend.\\n• Comments\\n• Share\\n• Text Size -1-1:\\n• Follow us on Twitter\\n• Become a Haaretz.com Faceboolr friend\\nThis story is by:\\n• atasha MozoovayaMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nThursday, October 14, 2010 7:37 AM\\nAbedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob J; H\\nFW: Jake and Huma on Time\\'s 40 under 40Ok will work on those and get back to you asapCalling nowFyi\\n10/13/2035Just as I put those guys back on the front foot - this came in.\\nLook forward to discussing.Martin Indyk is free for the next 40 minutes.

Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for\\ntheir nations\\' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the\\nNetherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In\\nHungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on \"Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire\\nworld.\" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its\\nleaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest\\'s\\nParliament.\\nContemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term \"radical populism,\" but to\\nanyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.\\nEconomic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the\\nfirst half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is\\nproducing the same toxic politics.\\nThe Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much\\nmore nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being\\nhelped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be\\npaid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.\\nBut Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it\\'s time to give\\n\"primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.\"\\nLike Jean-Marie Le Pen\\'s National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The\\nCzech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish\\norigins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical\\nRight in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: \"Antisemitism is crucial to the\\nPolish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a\\ngeneral hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy.\" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is\\nsuspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.\\nBut the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland\\'s best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-\\nwing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet,\\nKaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II\\nwhen \"Jews apologize for killing Poles.\"\\nMainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-\\nright European People\\'s Party, which groups Angela Merkel\\'s ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,\\nNicolas Sarkozy\\'s Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,\\nand Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held\\nVienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking \"Jewish\\ncapital\" in language even Haider didn\\'t dare utter.\\nSo radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-\\nimmigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain\\'s general election, all the main parties are seeking to\\nappease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living\\nand working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.\\nBut a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.\\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.html\\nB6\\nEit\\nWhat a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe\\nMarine Le Pen is moving her father\\'s rabble-rousing, far-right\\nparty away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in\\nthe process.\\nby Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010\\namuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux\\nMarine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)\\nleads today\\nJean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France\\'s far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate\\nfears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking\\nto the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party\\nfeasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the \"provocateur\" taunting\\nthe establishment, the \"toreador\" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these\\nyoungsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie\\'s time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he\\'s.\\ndetermined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. \"She has the will, the courage, the temperament\\nnecessary, and the competence,\" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. \"It seems to me indisputable that she is our\\ncamp\\'s best candidate for 2012.\"\\nTall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen\\'s youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She\\'s\\nexpected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she\\'s a passionate advocate of its core message: strong\\nFrench nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She\\'s a\\nfresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a\\nnew threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she\\'s more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.\\nIt\\'s a measure of the Le Pens\\' enhanced power that they\\'ve managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and\\ncast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began\\nafter his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in\\nelections this past March, Sarkozy\\'s UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So\\nhe decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking\\ncitizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or \"Gypsies\"),\\nbooting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His\\nabysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.\\nThe younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. \"I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,\" she says.\\n\"My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father.\" The old man could be painted as a\\ncreature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a \"sulfurous\" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front\\nwants to bill itself as \"neither left nor right.\" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine\\'s\\nrival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, \"tent pis,\" she says.\\nOther right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister\\nSilvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them\\nthe former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out\\nbetween Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly\\nIslamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of\\ntrying to build a new coalition government.\\nYet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that\\'s made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual\\ncaricature of \"people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,\" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes \"the American right\\nis much more to the right than the National Front.\" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers\\nmore effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she\\'s also a big believer in the state\\'s ability and obligation\\nto help its people. \"We feel the state should have the means to intervene,\" she says. \"We are very attached to public\\nservices A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,\" including \"access for all to\\nthe same level of health care.\"\\nLe Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by\\ncompeting factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the\\nfamily\\'s Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was\\nbrought down. The crime has never been solved. \"The worst part wasn\\'t just the attack, it was that not a single politician\\nsent a word of condolence,\" she says. \"It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you.\"\\nThat\\'s a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential\\nrace a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.\\nWith Barbie Nadeau in RomeFYI\\nThe Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.com\\nWar on terror: Obama softened the language, but\\nhardened Muslim hearts\\nThe Obama administration\\'s shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and soften Americans\\' fear of\\nIslam. But the new rhetoric hasn\\'t matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and abroad have been high.\\nBy Stuart Gottlieb\\nposted October 14, 2010 at 9:58 am EDT\\nNew Haven, Conn. —\\nOne of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration\\'s counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change America\\'s rhetorical approach\\nto the threat of terrorism, particularly Islamic terrorism. \"The language we use matters,\" President Obama told the Arabic satellite television station\\nAl Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W. Bush-era terms like \"war on terrorism,\" \"radical Islam,\" and\\n\"jihadist.\"The White House\\'s 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term \"Islamic terrorism\" with \"violent extremism.\"\\nThe purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.\\nFirst, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism, which Mr. Obama believes\\ncontributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was \"at war with Islam.\" Indeed, the new rhetoric has gone hand in hand with Obama\\'s outreach to\\nthe Muslim world to build \"a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest.\"\\nSecond, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans\\' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays directly into the hands of\\nextremists.\\nLanguage change ineffective\\nNow it is fair to ask whether Obama\\'s use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls suggest it hasn\\'t. The first, by the\\nBrookings Institution in Washington, shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in\\nObama\\'s approach toward their region dropped from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as \"discouraged\" by the Obama\\npresidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.\\nThe second, by the Pew Research Center, shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30 percent) than five years\\nearlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence more than other religions\\n(in 2002, it was 25 percent).\\nThese starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a propaganda-fueled activity – an\\nongoing battle to win hearts and minds and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in combating terrorism is vital\\n– the counterproductive \"smoke \\'em out\" rhetoric of the Bush administration is a case in point.\\nBut if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility – and thus effectiveness – of the overall\\ncounterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has dug itself into just such a hole.\\nRhetoric doesn\\'t match policy\\nWhen looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an administration that has ramped up the\\nwar in Afghanistan; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes; continues to hold more than 1,000 Muslim detainees in Guantanamo,\\nBagram, and other prisons; and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.\\nThis is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world and have only muddled\\nObama\\'s oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist movements.\\nThe price of downplaying the threat\\nA large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush\\'s hard-line tactics — the USA Patriot\\nAct, warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions the White House has consistently played down the threat, even in the face of a clear uptick in\\nterrorism activity.\\nFor example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing, Obama described the suspect as an \"isolated extremist,\" despite his ties to Al\\nQaeda. And the administration\\'s initial response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to\\ncall it a \"one-off\\' event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic terror plots\\nwere unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam.\\nThere is little doubt that the administration\\'s unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on the public\\'s trust. A Gallup\\npoll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent — up from 49\\npercent to 42 percent last fall.\\nTime to reverse the trend\\nObama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. His instincts to maintain aggressive\\ntactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric were sound. Yet his administration seems to have overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years — that\\noverstating the threat of terrorism has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that understates the threat, especially when detached from policy.\\nIt is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric — which has not paid\\ndividends at home or abroad — and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced and the policies employed to confront them.\\nStuart Gottlieb, a former foreign-policy adviser and speechwriter in the US Senate (1999-2003), is now director of policy studies at the Jackson Insti\\ntute for Global Affairs at Yale.

President Obama leads Sarah Palin 48 - 40 percent.\\nRomney, Huckabee, Palin and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are bunched together when Republican\\nvoters are asked who they prefer for the GOP\\'s 2012 presidential nomination, the independent Quinnipiac\\n(KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds.\\nDemocratic voters say 64 - 27 percent they do not want anyone to challenge President Obama for their party\\'s\\nnomination in 2012.\\n\"The Democratic base remains squarely behind President Barack Obama when it comes to his re-election, but\\nhis weakness among independent voters at this point makes his 2012 election prospects uncertain,\" said Peter\\nA. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.\\n\"The demographic splits in the electorate when voters are asked whether the president deserves a second term is\\na roadmap for his re-election strategists on how they need to focus their appeal. Only 39 percent of men, 34\\npercent of whites, 35 percent of political independents and 38 percent of those over age 35 think he deserves\\nfour more years in the Oval Office.\"\\nIn trial heats for 2012, former Massachusetts Gov. Romney receives 45 percent to 44 percent for Obama, while\\nthe president gets 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Huckabee. Matched against Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a\\nvirtual unknown to most voters, the president leads 45 - 36 percent.\\n\"At this point, former Alaska Gov. Palin runs the worst against President Obama. Daniels is essentially a\\ngeneric Republican because of his anonymity to most voters. Obama only gets 45 percent against him while he\\ngets 48 percent against Ms. Palin,\" said Brown. \"She is very unpopular among independents and although she\\nrecently said she thought she could defeat Obama, the data does not now necessarily support that assertion.\"\\n\"Unlike Daniels, who is a political unknown to most Americans, virtually all voters have formed an opinion\\nabout Palin and that opinion is not encouraging for her candidacy.\"\\nMs. Palin is viewed the most negatively by the American people of the possible Republican candidates in 2012.\\nShe is viewed unfavorable by 51 percent of voters and favorably by 36 percent. Among independents, the key\\nswing voting bloc, she has a negative 54 - 33 percent favorability rating.\\nHuckabee gets a 41 - 25 percent favorability rating and Romney gets a 38 - 26 percent score. Former U.S.\\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich gets a negative 30 - 43 percent score.\\nObama gets a 48 - 48 percent split overall, with a negative 43 - 52 percent among independent voters.\\nIn a mythical Republican primary Ms. Palin gets 19 percent, including 25 percent of GOP women, followed by\\nRomney with 18 percent, Huckabee at 17 percent, Gingrich at 15 percent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6\\npercent and Daniels, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota at 2 percent each.\\n\"The best thing Obama has going for him when it comes to his re-election may be that at this point the\\nRepublicans don\\'t have a candidate who is both nationally well-known and well- liked by a majority of voters,\"\\nsaid Brown.\\nFrom November 8 - 15, Quinnipiac University surveyed 2,424 registered voters nationwide, live by telephone,\\nwith a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.\\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in\\nPennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for\\nresearch.

His approach depends first\\non securing end-game \"deposits\" from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might\\nnot be willing to give at the onset, but that can be \"deposited\" with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side is\\nwilling to do the same. Saudi Arabia\\'s deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included details\\nabout Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises\\nthe Palestinians would need to accept.\\nMuasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track—asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return for\\nfull Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to\\naddress the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end all\\nlogistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility for\\ndelivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel\\'s deposit would spell out its\\ncommitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan.\\nAccording to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending\\nthe conflict. After he has been given Arab cover, Abbas could provide his own end-game deposits. According to\\nMuasher, absent these commitments from the Arab states, the Palestinian positions will remain maximalist. Once the\\nU.S. has deposits from all sides that make for a reasonable, comprehensive package, it should put this package on the\\ntable in cooperation with the Quartet. Once the comprehensive package is presented, the U.S. can focus on confidence-\\nbuilding measures to move all sides toward the end game.\\nAMI\\'m sending 2 emails today b/c I didn\\'t send one yesterday. :-)\\nAttached is a one-pager fleshing out how we could launch a Pledge for Palestine based on the Warren Buffett model.

Groups\\nBegins\\nBy MICHAEL LUO\\nIn what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections, David Brock, a prominent Democratic political\\noperative, says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to set\\nup what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican-leaning outside\\ngroups that spent so heavily on this year\\'s midterm elections.\\nKathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy\\'s 11 children,\\nhas agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group, which will be called American Bridge, lending to the still extremely\\nnascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics.\\nLeading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay, heir to the Taco Bell\\nfortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, who heads\\nDyson-Kissner-Moran, a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey, a television producer who\\ngave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004.\\nMr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to\\nset up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning it will\\nbe able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors.\\nCertain to set off debate, however, is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raising\\nconsultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one of\\nthe nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, which does not disclose its donors.\\nThe action network, which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations, is organized as a 501(c)(4)\\nnonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads,\\naccording to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge\\'s and Media Matter Action Network\\'s plans obtained\\nby The New York Times.\\nMr. Brock said that \"money is money,\" and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and, in the end, the media\\nspending would be apportioned accordingly.\\nThe moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists to\\nestablish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left\\'s answer in 2012 to such groups on the\\nright as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and others, which significantly outspent Democratic-\\nleaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock\\'s group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giant\\ncontributions on the left.\\nMr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction after\\nthe Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups.\\nBut Mr. Brock, a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s, is a respected political\\nplayer, who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Matters\\numbrella.\\nMr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year.\\nIts backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1\\nmillion to the group; Peter B. Lewis, the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance, who, like Mr. Soros, gave more\\nthan $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in 2004; and the Hollywood producer Steve Bing.\\n\"My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollars\\nto these types of efforts,\" Mr. Brock said. \"They just need to be asked, and I have no doubt they will step up at this critical\\ntime.\"\\nThere also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to be\\nmore heavily involved in the 2012 elections.\\nWhite House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic-\\nleaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections, a change from the Obama campaign\\'s attitude toward such\\ngroups in 2008. But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed.\\nThe lack of disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year as\\nspending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections.\\nBut the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White House and to win back some of\\nwhat was lost in the House and Senate may trump those principles. Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raise\\nmoney if the option of offering anonymity is available.\\n\"It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on, to essentially tie one hand behind your back,\" Mr. McKay said.\\nBesides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts.\\nOn Monday, for instance, Steve Rosenthal, who was the chief executive of America Coming Together, a Democratic fund-\\nraising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election, convened a group of political operatives, many of\\nwhom were active in that election, at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012.\\nNo one, however, has apparently gone as far as Mr. Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up an\\norganization.\\nMr. Brock said the $4 million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank account by the end\\nof the first quarter of 2011.\\nBy way of comparison, America\\'s Families First Action Fund, one of the major Democratic independent efforts in House\\nraces this year, raised just over $4 million for the entire cycle up until mid-October.\\nThe internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year, including initially focusing\\non attacking vulnerable Republicans in the Senate and the House, as a prelude to major spending in 2012.yesEric DID regret the invite mentioned on your call grid yesterday (11/22).

The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health care\\nlegislation Congress pushed through.\\nAll polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over the\\nHouse. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control of\\nspending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms.\\nLet\\'s start with spending:\\nThe basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As we\\nwrote nearly a week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to us\\nthat they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This will\\nbe one of the top Republican priorities.\\nFreezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However, even in the unlikely event the Republicans do\\nnot take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last time\\nmoney was formally appropriated).\\nSince there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October, the Congress has\\nto pass a \"continuing resolution\" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made\\n(the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuing\\nresolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority).\\nCongress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the new\\nCongress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, but\\nthat would be cutting it close and too cute.\\nBecause the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will be\\ndominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner\\'s CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it more\\nmoderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it and\\ntake the hit.\\nIn turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan to\\nslow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills.\\nThe first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rules\\nrequires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that\\'s money. By freezing spending at previous levels\\nyou freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process.\\nAdd to that Boehner\\'s commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you\\'ve got a tidal\\nwave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting to\\nsee one of those).\\nThe hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws will\\naccomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strike\\ndown parts of the health care bill now under appeal.\\nTHE SENATE\\nWhile everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven\\'t), the attention should be on\\nwhat the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails.\\nThe point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got a\\nglimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the health\\ncare public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges.\\nThe incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes and\\nregulatory oversight. They will make Boehner\\'s job much easier\\nTake a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn into\\noffice).\\nWhile some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats, all of them are generally considered\\nmore conservative than their predecessors:\\n1. ck (CO) - likely winner\\n2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner\\n3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner\\n4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner\\n5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner\\n6. Portman (OH) -likely winner\\n7. Coats (IN) - likely winner\\n8. Paul (KY) - likely winner\\n9. Miller (AK) - likely winner\\n10. Lee (UT) - likely winner\\n11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner\\n12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner\\n13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP)\\n14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup\\nThere are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These races\\ncontinue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer.\\nThese likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate:\\n1. DeMint (SC)\\n2. Coburn (OK)\\n3. Inhofe (OK)\\n4. McConnell (KY)\\n5. Kyl (AZ)\\n6. McCain (AZ)\\n7. Thune (SD)\\n8. Crapo (ID)\\n9. Vitter (LA)\\n10. Burr (NC)\\nOne aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail\\'s pace, and Republicans operated efficiently as a\\nminority party with only 41 votes total. In January, there will be at least 22 new and existing serious road\\nblocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for cloture\\nimpossible on spending bills.\\nWelcome to the new reality.Sullivan, Jacob J <SullivanJJ@state.gov>\\nMonday, September 20, 2010 7:33 AM\\nSaudis\\nThis is the readout we got from Denise Moraga, who is traveling with Brennan:Slaughter, Anne-Marie <SlaughterA@state.gov>\\nTuesday, November 23, 2010 11:52 PM\\nAbedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob J; Mills, Cheryl D\\nChet Crocker, Scott Lasensky, and Sam Lewis OPED on MEP\\nCrocker Lasensky Lewis OPED.doc\\nI\\'m abusing my privileges and sending you two emails in one evening,\\npublished yet.\\nNovember 2010\\nDeclaring America\\'s Stand on Middle East Peace\\nBy Chester A. Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky and Samuel W. Lewis\\nFaltering Middle East peace talks need a jolt. Washington has a powerful option for moving the process forward: taking\\na firm stand on how to end the conflict.\\nAn American declaration of principles—carefully crafted and properly marketed--could spark a debate and thereby\\nchange the political calculus for leaders. As a mediator and a world power, one of America\\'s strongest assets is the\\nability to legitimize ideas and then rally others in support. A central role for the U.S. in this conflict must be to define the\\nzone of negotiability.\\nThis does not mean imposing peace. Rather, it would be a statement of the basic principles the U.S. believes can guide\\nthe parties toward a negotiated solution. America has long declared its support for \"two states,\" but must now say more\\nabout what that means in practice.\\nEven if the current talks resume, without American ideas the parties are unlikely to agree on the broad trade-offs\\nnecessary to reach a peace deal. A quick deal on \"borders and security,\" as many have proposed, is itself unlikely\\nwithout Washington addressing the end-game. Otherwise, both sides would be too exposed on issues set for later\\ndiscussion, like Jerusalem and refugees. Opinion polling has consistently showed that support for peace is strongest\\nwhen all the core issues are addressed.\\nAn American statement of principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, for the first time, a public\\nframework for engaging sponsors of the Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen our ability to reassert the\\nimportance of a regional support structure for the bilateral negotiations, especially by reviving multilateral contacts and\\nmeetings involving Israelis and their neighbors from throughout the region. Moreover, greater regional engagement on\\nthe peace process can carry powerful benefits for regional challenges like the Iranian nuclear program.\\nA clearer U.S. declaration is also the surest way to protect prospects for a two-state solution from an unrelenting\\nonslaught on the ground that pushes the parties away from a peace deal. An American set of ideas would anchor\\npresent-day demands on issues like Jerusalem, security and settlements in a clear vision of the future.\\nPerhaps most urgently, it would broaden the debate from the narrow confines of the settlements question.\\nAt a minimum, the American declaration should be based on the 1967 lines, with agreed territorial swaps; support a\\ncompromise on Jerusalem that allows for two capitals for two states; include provisions about security limitations and\\nguarantees; reiterate America\\'s support for an agreed solution to the refugee problem; and reaffirm our long-standing\\ncommitment to the State of Israel. But American principles should also include some caveat, given that our ultimate\\ninterest is in an agreed, viable solution—not in any particular formula.\\nWhat would it take for American ideas to succeed? Unlike some past efforts, Washington should not try to \\'pre-cook\\'\\nthis declaration with one or more parties or to choreograph their reactions. In fact, the U.S. statement of principles\\nwould be explicitly described as what our own country believes in and can support; and by implication cannot support.\\nThus, the U.S. statement would not be designed to achieve immediate approval or adoption by the parties. Its purpose\\nwould be to clarify where America stands, how we define our interests and what we can work for. It would aim at\\ninfluencing the climate of thinking in the region, sobering up those with illusions and encouraging those who need our\\nsupport.\\nTiming and context are of course key considerations. Assuming the current gridlock in negotiations persists, some time\\nmust elapse until our election results have been digested, here and abroad, and before public attention can be\\nredirected toward the foreboding and increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate.\\nA presidential speech will then be essential to dramatize the seriousness of our purpose and to lay out the principles. It\\nshould be immediately followed by a major, high level diplomatic effort to persuade key Middle East leaders and our\\nQuartet and UN allies of our genuine desire to regionalize the peacemaking effort. To maximize support from key\\nmembers of Congress, the speech should occur before Congress adjourns. No further consultation with the stalemated\\nparties beyond the routine should precede the speech, and leaks of its contents must be kept to an absolute minimum if\\nour purpose is not to be undermined.\\nThe speech could usefully also remove some of the veil of silence that shrouds breakthroughs in past negotiations; for\\nexample, progress in the Annapolis process.\\nAs for the substance, in its endorsement of a two-state solution and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, the Obama\\nAdministration has hinted that a Palestinian settlement should also accompany normalized relations between Israel and\\nthe Arab states, putting a broader framing around what has traditionally been defined as a conflict between Israel and\\nits immediate neighbors. The normalization piece of the puzzle should be more fully articulated as part of a new strategy\\nbased on presenting American ideas to the parties. It is a way to entice skeptical Israelis, but it also leads back to a long\\noverdue need for Washington to engage on the Arab Peace Initiative.\\nIf the U.S. puts forward its own peace principles, American leadership can ensure that any diplomatic process is defined\\nby as clear a picture as possible of what the parties can expect to gain through a negotiated settlement, and of what\\nthey will never gain without one.\\nSkeptics say it is too risky to present American ideas to the parties, that it would pull the rug out from under current\\nleaders, exposing them to withering domestic criticism. Others argue that it will galvanize obstructionists, not those who\\nsupport compromise, and could very well precipitate a crisis on the ground. Others simply worry about the cost to\\nAmerican prestige should any of the key players react negatively. But the risks are overstated, and a complete collapse\\nof the process would be far more dangerous, particularly as the strategic environment shifts in favor of regional forces\\nthat seek to undermine, rather than promote peace.\\nAmerica can and must do more than limit itself to managing a conflict that has all too often upended our shared\\ninterests in peace and stability.\\nEND\\nChester A.

An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an\\nattempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families\\nwere targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a\\nvery high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.\\nU.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on\\nunderstanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in\\nMonterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August\\n20.

Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million\\ndollars to right-wing causes.\\nOn May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the\\nstage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his\\ngenerosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company\\'s upcoming season,\\nand had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala\\'s co-chairs, Blaine Trump,\\nin a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy\\'s mother, Jacqueline Kennedy\\nOnassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had\\nbought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.\\nThe gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city\\'s most prominent\\nphilanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center\\'s New York State Theatre building,\\nwhich now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is\\nnamed for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch\\npledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in\\nthe city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million\\ndollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.\\nOne dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event\\'s third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office\\nsaid that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might\\nhave created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth\\nattacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.\\nWith his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,\\nheadquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has\\ngrown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in\\nAlaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,\\nDixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest\\nprivate company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years\\nago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is\\nexceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.\\nThe Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services\\nfor the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the\\nbrothers\\' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst\\'s Political Economy\\nResearch Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report\\nidentifying the company as a \"kingpin of climate science denial.\" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly\\noutdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting\\'a huge\\nnetwork of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against\\nso many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,\\ntheir ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.\\nIn a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report \"distorts the environmental record of our companies.\" And. .\\nDavid Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the \"radical press\" had turned his family into\\n\"whipping boys,\" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for\\nPublic Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, \"The Kochs are on a whole different level. There\\'s no one else who has\\nspent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political\\nmanipulation, and obfuscation. I\\'ve been in Washington since Watergate, and I\\'ve never seen anything like it. They are the\\nStandard Oil of our times.\"\\nfew weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that\\nDavid Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending\\nthe American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,\\nlie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance\\nperformance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,\\nwarned that Administration officials \"have a socialist visiOn for this country.\"\\nFive hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An\\nadvertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. \"Today, the voices of average Americans are\\nbeing drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,\" it said. \"But you can do something about it.\" The pitch made no mention\\nof its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .\\nAxelrod, Obama\\'s senior adviser, said, \"What they don\\'t say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens\\' movement brought to\\nyou by a bunch of oil billionaires.\"\\nIn April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying\\nthat Americans for Prosperity is \"an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.\"\\n.Later, she issued a statement: \"No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or\\nDavid Koch specifically to support the tea parties.\" David Koch told New York, \"I\\'ve never been to a tea-party event. No one\\nrepresenting the tea party has ever even approached me.\"\\nAt the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for\\nProsperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: \"We love what the Tea\\nParties are doing, because that\\'s how we\\'re going to take back America!\" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent\\ninterview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, \"I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!\"\\nShe explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help \"educate\" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give\\nthem \"next-step training\" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled \"more effectively.\" And she noted\\nthat Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.\\n\"They\\'re certainly our people. David\\'s the chairman of our board. I\\'ve certainly met with them, and I\\'m very appreciative Of\\nwhat they do.\"\\nVenable honored several Tea Party \"citizen leaders\" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its\\nBlogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as\\nthe \"cokehead in chief.\" In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of \"demonic\\npossession (aka schizophrenia, etc.).\" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best\\nknown for her role on the television series \"Northern Exposure.\" She declared, \"They don\\'t want our children to know about\\ntheir rights. They don\\'t want our children to know about a God!\"\\nDuring a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama\\nwas \"the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,\" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—\"the government\\ntaking over our economy and our lives.\" Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!\" As the\\ncrowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: \"Victory, or death!\"\\nAmericans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement\\'s inception. In the weeks before the\\nfirst Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters \"Tea Party Talking\\nPoints.\" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for\\n\"Taxpayer Tea Party Registration\" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The\\nNorth Carolina branch recently launched a \"Tea Party Finder\" Web site, advertised as \"a hub for all the Tea Parties in North\\nCarolina.\"\\nThe anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to\\n\"educate,\" fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce\\nBartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based\\nthink tank that the Kochs fund, said, \"The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it\\'s been all chiefs and no\\nIndians. There haven\\'t been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been\\ntrying to create a movement.\" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, \"everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there\\nare Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power.\" The Kochs, he said, are \"trying to shape and control and\\nchannel the populist uprising into their own policies.\"-\\nA Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, \"The\\nKoch brothers gave the money that founded it. It\\'s like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the\\nfrogs come out of the mud—and they\\'re our candidates!\"\\nThe Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations\\nexecutive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer\\nZuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,\\ncalled him \"a patriot who cares deeply about his country.\" Zuckerman praised David\\'s \"gentle decency\" and the \"range of his\\npublic interests.\"\\nThe Republican campaign consultant said of the family\\'s political activities, \"To call them under the radar is an\\nunderstatement. They are underground!\" Another former Koch adviser said, \"They\\'re smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff\\nworks for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves.\" Rob Stein, a Democratic political\\nstrategist who has studied the conservative movement\\'s finances, said that the Kochs are \"at the epicenter of the anti-Obama\\nmovement. But it\\'s not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •\\nClinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.\"\\nddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch\\nprinter who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical\\nengineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore,\\nAmerica\\'s major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch\\nfound work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin\\'s regime\\nset up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch\\'s Soviet colleagues. Koch was\\ndeeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,\\nRock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been\\ndestroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, \"As the Soviets became a\\nstronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.\"\\nIn 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in\\npart, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President\\nDwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists have\\ninfiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties.\" He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini\\'s suppression of Communists\\nin Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. \"The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take\\nover America,\" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment \"a vicious race\\nwar.\" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party\\'s talk of a secret \\'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would\\n\"infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.\"\\nKoch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,\\nDavid and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David\\'s schoolmate and friend. He\\nrecalled that Fred Koch was \"a real John Wayne type.\" Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in\\nAfrica, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across\\nfrom Wichita\\'s country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed\\nto join them. \"By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn\\'t seem like a favor\\nback then,\" Charles has written. \"By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time.\" David Koch\\nrecalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. \"He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong\\nwith government,\" he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of \"Radicals for\\nCapitalism,\" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. \"It\\'s something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big\\ngovernment was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.\"\\nDavid attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William\\nall earned engineering degrees at their father\\'s alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually\\nassumed control, with David as his deputy; William\\'s career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and\\nstudied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.\\n(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:)\\nIn 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred\\nKoch\\'s will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at\\nDeerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school\\'s sole \"lifetime trustee.\" He said, \"You\\nmight ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when\\nI was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for\\nten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,\\nyear after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!\"\\nDavid and Charles had absorbed their father\\'s conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to\\ndiZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in\\nWichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs\\' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. \"It was\\npretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,\" diZerega recalled.\\nDiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-science\\nprofessor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is\\none of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward\\nintellectual trajectory, transferring their father\\'s paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and\\nseeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega\\nwrites, \"As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.\\n\\'Socialism\\' kept. being defined downwards.\"\\nMembers of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market\\nideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of \"The Road to\\nSerfdom\" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek\\'S belief in\\nunfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters\\nhave championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted \"The\\nRoad to Serfdom\" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the\\nKochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, \"I want to thank Charles Koch for this\\ninformation.\" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)\\nCharles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state\\nbut didn\\'t like the label \"anarchist\"; he called himself an \"autarchist.\" LeFevre liked to say that \"government is a disease\\nmasquerading as its own cure.\" In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian\\nDoherty, of Reason, told me that \"LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles\\'s heart,\" and that the school was \"a tiny\\nworld of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake.\" According to diZerega, Charles supported the school\\nfinancially, and even gave him money to take classes there.\\nThroughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from\\nFreddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the\\ncompany\\'s board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (\"Charles runs it all with an iron hand,\" Bruce Bartlett, the\\neconomist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,\\nCharles and David bought out their brothers\\' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,\\nand litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past\\none another with stony expressions at their mother\\'s funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.\\nHe bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary\\nmanuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five\\nmillion dollars to win the America\\'s Cup, in 1992.\\nWith Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the\\ninvestment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company\\'s performance has been \"beyond phenomenal.\" Charles remained\\nin Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New\\nYork City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A\\nfinancial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, \"Charles is the company. Charles runs it.\" David, described by\\nassociates as \"affable\" and \"a bit of a lunk,\" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of\\nFrance and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened\\nto an \"East Coast version of Hugh Hefher\\'s soirees.\" In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-\\nthousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David\\'s manner is more cosmopolitan, and\\nmore genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn\\'t think of a single issue on which\\nthe brothers disagreed.\\nAs their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in\\nAmerica. Charles\\'s goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government \"out at the root.\" The brothers\\' first major public\\nstep came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the\\nLibertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the\\nright. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential\\nslot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket\\'s\\nslogan was \"The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You.\" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,\\nwho spent more than two million dollars on the effort.\\nMany of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that\\nlibertarians were getting ready to stage \"a very big tea party,\" because people were \"sick to death\" of taxes. The Libertarian\\nParty platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage\\nlaws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,\\nand suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a\\nmore traditional conservative, called the movement \"Anarcho-Totalitarianism.\"\\nThat November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of\\npolitics didn\\'t sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. \"It tends to be a nasty,\\ncorrupting business,\" he told a reporter at the time. \"I\\'m interested in advancing libertarian ideas.\" According to Doherty\\'s\\nbook, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely \"actors playing out a script.\" A longtime confidant of the Kochs\\ntold Doherty that the brothers wanted to \"supply the themes and words for the scripts.\" In order to alter the direction of\\nAmerica, they had to \"influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.\"\\nfter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million\\n. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family\\nfoundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which\\nthey direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and\\nlobbyists. The family\\'s subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,\\nhas called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate.\"\\nOnly the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008\\nthe Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable\\nFoundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent\\nmore than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.\\nMeanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company\\'s\\npolitical-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty\\nper cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political\\ncontributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members\\nhave personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David\\nKoch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.\\nOther gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically\\nactive nonprofit groups.\\nIn recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In\\nthe nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding\\nright-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of\\nAndrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the\\nDemocratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs\\' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal\\nfunds: \"Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.\"\\nOf course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the\\nOpen Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous\\nprivate contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama\\'s. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that\\nSoros\\'s giving is transparent, and that \"none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests.\" The Kochs\\nhave given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.\\nGus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs\\' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a\\nrationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, \"Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.\"\\nSome critics have suggested that the Kochs\\' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable\\nfoundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National\\nCommittee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs\\' foundations as being self-serving,\\nconcluding, \"These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the\\nprofit margin of Koch Industries.\"\\nThe Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the\\ncountry in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files.\\nlawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and\\nthe Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the\\nKochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has\\nacknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. \"If we\\'re going to give a lot of money, we\\'ll make darn sure they •\\nspend it in a way that goes along with our intent,\" he told Doherty. \"And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we\\ndon\\'t agree with, we withdraw funding.\"\\nhe Kochs\\' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that\\nLewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar\\nmovement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest\\ncrusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight\\nback. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, \"respectable elements\\nof society\"—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,\\n• unified campaign to change public opinion.\\nCharles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. \"To bring about\\nsocial change,\" he told Doherty, requires \"a strategy\" that is \"vertically and horizontally integrated,\" spanning \"from idea\\ncreation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action.\" The project,\\nhe admitted, was extremely ambitious. \"We have a radical philosophy,\" he said.\\nIn 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation\\'s first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the\\n\\'Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Cato\\nhas more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the\\nmainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has\\nconsistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.\\nWhen President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as \"beyond dispute,\" the Cato Institute\\ntook out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato\\'s resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to\\nstop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute\\'s founder and president, told me\\nthat \"global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.\"\\nCato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate\\nscientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest a\\nwillingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went\\npublic, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries\\nhave since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on\\nglobal warming. •\\nNevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic\\nand Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, more\\nAmericans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The\\nKochs promote this statistic on their company\\'s Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering\\nsuch doubt.\\nIn a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as \"voters believe there is no consensus\\nabout global warming within the scientific community\\' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental\\nreform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to\\nforestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, which\\nhas argued that \"scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.\"\\nThe brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women\\'s Forum, which opposes the\\npresentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by Nancy\\nPfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group\\'s\\nboard.\\nNaomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of\\n\"Merchants of Doubt,\" a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on\\nscience. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of \"a company with refineries and pipelines,\" have \"a lot at stake.\" She added,\\n\"If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn\\'t be\\nsurprised that they\\'re fighting tooth and nail.\"\\nDavid Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has\\nbeen, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. \"The\\nEarth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food,\" he said.\\nn the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another\\nthink tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as \"the world\\'s premier university source for market-oriented\\nideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems.\" Financial records show that the Koch family\\nfoundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar\\'s to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus\\nCenter, a nonprofit organization. \"It\\'s ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington,\" Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist,\\nsaid. It is an unusual arrangement. \"George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds,\" Stein noted. \"Virginia is\\nhosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.\"\\nThe founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries\\' lobbying\\noperation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the\\nClaude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-\\nfounder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.\\nFink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed\\nCrane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers\\' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato,\\nCharles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles\\'s\\nmanagement philosophy, which he distilled into a book called \"The Science of Success,\" and trademarked under the name\\nMarket-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company\\'s corporate culture with the\\ncompetitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a \"holistic system\" containing \"five dimensions: vision, virtue\\nand talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives.\" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles \"thinks he\\'s\\na genius. He\\'s the emperor, and he\\'s convinced he\\'s wearing clothes.\" Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing of\\nCharles\\'s ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to. be interviewed.)\\nAt a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus\\nCenter\\'s purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw\\nmaterials into policy \"products.\"\\nThe Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center \"the most important think tank you\\'ve never heard of,\" and noted\\nthat fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a \"hit list\" had been suggested first by\\nMercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have \"other means of fighting [their] battles,\" and that the Mercatus\\nCenter does riot actively promote the company\\'s private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of\\nTexas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that \"Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and\\nMercatus has constantly hammered on the agency.\" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called\\nit \"a means of laundering economic aims.\" The lawyer explained the strategy: \"You take corporate money and give it to a\\nneutral-sounding think tank,\" which \"hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.\\nBut they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.\"\\nIn 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil\\nrefineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the \\'Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. The\\nE.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that\\nif pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.\\nIn 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took \\'up Dudley\\'s smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the court\\nfound that the E.P.A. had \"explicitly disregarded\" the \"possible health benefits of ozone.\" In another part of the opinion, the\\ncourt ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional\\nAccountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montana\\nranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family\\nfoundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.\\ndeas don\\'t happen on their own,\" Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me.\\n\"Throughout history, ideas need patrons.\" The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think\\ntanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract the\\npublic\\'s support. in 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group,\\nCitizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was\\nsponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, \"was to take\\nthese heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent\\nrevolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of\\nnonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates.\" Within a few years, the\\ngroup had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs\\' agenda. David and Charles,\\naccording to one participant, were \"very controlling, very top down. You can\\'t build an organization with them. They run it.\"\\nAround this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated\\ntheir business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of \"a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil\\nfrom Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring.\" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one\\nmillion dollars\\' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil\\nmeasurement is \"a very uncertain art.\"\\nTo defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon\\nopened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without\\nissuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal\\nlives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs\\' tactics. Kenneth Batten,\\nthe counsel to the Senate committee, said, \"These people have amassed such unaccountable power!\\'\\n.\\'\\nBy •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of\\ncorporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on\\nClinton\\'s proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.\\nAnd it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as \"designed to strike fear into the hearts of\\nwavering Democrats.\" Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled,\\n\"I\\'d been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of\\n\\'resources and effort—their employees, too.\" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. \"I can\\'t prove it, but I think I was probably\\ntheir victim,\" he said.\\nThe Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made\\nit difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff\\ngroup, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems \"myths.\" When the\\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had \"no citizen membership of its own.\"\\nIn 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called \"an audacious plan to pour millions\\nof dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,\" in order to evade\\ncampaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in\\ntwenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,\\nthe Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee\\'s minority report suggested that \"the trust was financed in whole or in\\npart by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas.\" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,\\nmost of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,\\nthe funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the\\nmoney, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs\\' payroll had\\nbeen involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as \"historic. Triad was the\\nfirst time a major corporation used a cutout\"—a front operation—\"in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of\\na company run amok.\"\\nuring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice\\nDepartment filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,\\nwhich had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two\\nhundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to\\nspend five million dollars on environmental projects.\\nIn 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion\\nthat resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final\\nmonths of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for\\ncovering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company\\nwas liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.\\nThe Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including\\nthe falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,\\nheaded the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as \"one of the most significant cases ever\\nbrought under the Clean Air Act.\" He added, \"Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,\\nand in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.\"\\nDuring the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies\\nof George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed\\nremarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered\\nenormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a\\nstudy by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since\\n2000.\\nIn 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush\\'s reelection. The\\ngroup\\'s Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for\\nJohn Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political\\npurposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)\\nThat year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink\\nstarted a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had\\nworked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-\\nconsulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips\\'s online biography\\ndescribes him as an expert in \"grasstops\" and \"grassroots\" political organizing. The Kochs\\' choice of Phillips signalled an even\\ngreater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising \"throat slitters\" in politics, called\\nPhillips \"a grownup who can make things happen.\"\\nLast year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.\\nCurrently, its Web site claims that the group has \"1.2 million activists.\" Whatever its size, the Kochs\\' political involvement has\\nbeen intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity \"was micromanaged by the Kochs.\"\\nAnd the brothers\\' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family\\'s other\\norganizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.\\nIn January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of \"the greatest loss of\\nliberty and prosperity since the 1930s.\" That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at\\na Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern,\\nthanked David Koch, and vowed to \"unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!\" Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americans\\nfor Prosperity launched \"Porkulus\" rallies against Obama\\'s stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a\\nreport claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was\\nforced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obama\\'s program \"a slush fund,\" and\\nFox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for\\nProsperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often\\nguest-hosts for Limbaugh.)\\nAmericans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be\\nmore than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at\\nanother, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the \"Kill the Bill\" protests\\noutside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.\\nPhillips was a featured speaker.\\nAmericans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making\\nindustries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard\\nbarbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama\\'s \"green jobs\" czar, Van\\nJones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would\\nbe hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference\\non climate change, declaring, \"We\\'re a grassroots organization.... 1 think it\\'s unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy\\nfamilies . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.\"\\nGrover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from\\nAmericans for Prosperity, told me that last summer\\'s raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama\\'s agenda. The\\nRepublican leadership in Congress, he said, \"couldn\\'t have clone it without August, when people went out on the streets. It\\ndiscouraged deal-makers\"—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the\\nappearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. \"K Street is a three-billion-dollar\\nweathervane,\" Norquist said. \"When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, \\'We can work with the Obama\\nAdministration.\\' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and \\'terrorized\\' congressmen. August is what\\nchanged it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.\"\\nAs the first anniversary of Obama\\'s election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant\\nAmericans for Prosperity gathering. Obama\\'s poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with\\nthe Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama\\'s political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups\\nwere accusing the President of initiating \"a government takeover.\" In a speech, Koch said, \"Days like today bring to reality the\\nvision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago.\" He went on, \"We envisioned a mass\\nmovement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life\\nstanding up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully,\\nthe stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are\\nbeginning to see the same truths as we do.\" .\\nWhile Koch didn\\'t explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so,\\npraising it for demonstrating the \"powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government\\npower, the massive efforts to socialize this country.\" Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,\\ncompared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs\\' sense of\\nimperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and\\nsince the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers\\' message has\\nevidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.\\nAmericans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the\\nmidterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless\\nplans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and\\nrunning ads aimed at \"educating voters about where candidates stand.\"\\nThough the Kochs have slowed Obama\\'s momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed\\nby FrumForum.com this spring, said, \"If you look at where we\\'ve gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of\\ngovernment spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn\\'t look very good at all.\" He went on, \"It\\nlooks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day.\" He suggested that the Kochs needed \"to get\\nmore into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.\"\\nn 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he\\nwas recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a\\nfamily, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, \"When you\\'re the only one who survived in the front of the plane and\\neveryone.else died—yeah, you think, \\'My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.\\' My joke is that I\\'ve been\\nbusy ever since, doing all the good work 1 can think of, so He can have confidence in me.\"\\nKoch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,\\nfocussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-\\nPresbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins\\nUniversity, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-\\nKettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer\\nAdvisory Board, which guides the National.Cancer Institute.\\nKoch\\'s corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that David\\nKoch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the\\nE.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a \"known carcinogen\" in humans.\\nScientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded\\nthat formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on\\n•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed\\nto higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within\\nthe National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly\\ncontrolled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch\\nIndustries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulations\\nuntil more studies are completed.\\nKoch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-\\nproducts company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and uses\\nit to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2\\nbillion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific\\'s vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal\\nletter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company \"strongly disagrees\" with the N.I.H. panel\\'s conclusion\\nthat formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National\\nCancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep\\nformaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)\\nJames Fluff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told\\nme that it was \"disgusting\" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: \"It\\'s just not good for public health.\\nVested interests should not be on the board.\" He \\'went on, \"Those boards are very important. They\\'re very influential as to\\nwhether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.\"\\nHarold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he\\nused to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, \"a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we\\nwouldn\\'t tolerate in our board members is tobacco.\" When told of Koch Industries\\' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that\\nhe was \"surprised.\"\\nhe David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian\\'s National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia\\nexploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted\\nwith a giant graph charting the Earth\\'s temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it\\nwas ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, \"HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD.\" The\\nmessage, as amplified by the exhibit\\'s Web site, is that \"key human adaptations evolved in response to\\nenvironmental instability.\" Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline \"OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE,\" is it noted\\nthat levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase\\ndramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role\\nplayed by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, \"During\\nthe period in which humans evolved, Earth\\'s temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\\nfluctuated together.\" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate\\nchange in the future. People may build \"underground cities;\" developing \"short, compact bodies\" or \"curved spines,\"\\nso that \"moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.\"\\nSuch ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company\\'s January newsletter to employees, for instance, argueS that\\n\"fluctuations in the earth\\'s climate predate humanity,\" and concludes, \"Since we can\\'t control Mother Nature, let\\'s figure out\\nhow to get along with her changes.\" Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by the\\nSmithsonian\\'s presentation. \"The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,\" he said. \"I think the Kochs wanted to\\nbe seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.\\nBut the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal\\nwith this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.\"\\nCristian Samper, the museum\\'s director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as \"one of the\\nbest donors we\\'ve had, in my tenure here, because he\\'s very interested in the content, but completely hands off.\" He noted, \"1.\\ndon\\'t know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.\"\\nThe Kochs have long depended on the public\\'s not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what\\nDavid Koch has called \"the largest company that you\\'ve never heard of.\" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party,\\nand with increased awareness of the Kochs\\' ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently,\\nPresident °barna took aim at the Kochs\\' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, in\\nAustin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court\\'s recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws\\nprohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind \"groups with\\nharmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity.\" Obama said, \"They don\\'t have to say who, exactly, Americans for\\nProsperity are. You don\\'t know if it\\'s a foreign-controlled corporation\"—or even, he added, \"a big oil company.\"Thank you and your wonderful family\\nHarold Hongju Koh\\nThe Legal Adviser\\nU.S. Department of State\\nSuite 6421\\n2201 C St. NW\\nWashington, DC 20520-6421\\n202 647 9598 office\\nmobile\\n202 647 7096 faxAnytime - I\\'ve got my phone with me.Am in office today.\\nMeetings at 8:30am, 9am, 9:30, 10am and then none b/w 11am - 2pm.\\ncdm\\n--Madame Secretary:\\nI\\'d like to update you on our efforts to engage with Bolivia.\\nYou engaged personally and through Maria Echaveste as we\\'ve tried to think and act creatively to extract positives from\\na difficult starting point.

(I have\\nsent some of those to your office). They include papers on security, Palestinian institution building, public attitudes in\\nIsrael and the territories, etc.\\nI will deliver a set of those papers to your office on Monday\\nIf it would be useful, I would be happy to convene a small, private discussion with some of the sharpest people in the\\ngroup, or give you some names.\\nA few observations following up our call this am.:\\n(1) This (a Framework Agreement) is very difficult but I don\\'t think impossible. If Bibi can say he has secured\\nunprecedented commitments on security and established the principle of a Jewish state, he could decide to\\nplay the historic leader. If he is uncompromising, he will have to deal with the consequences for US-Israeli\\nrelations. His opt out, of course, is to blame the Pais, but we will be \"in the room\".\\n(2) I think this should be a negotiation that goes from principle to paper rather than the other way around, i.e. not\\nan early exchange of documents that dig each side into its positions. The two leaders need to feel each\\nother out first at the level of first principles, to be distilled after a period by the U.S.\\n(3) Not sure we need to be in every meeting.. Ultimately, they need to establish some trust. But we (you or\\nMitchell) need to be present enough to make sure that there is no misunderstanding of what has been\\nagreed, and to move things along. .\\n(4) On the critical issue of security, I don\\'t think the Israelis any more trust NATO to stand firm. They will expect\\nan IDF presence in the Jordan Valley for some time. Palestinians recognize that there will be a transitional\\nphase. Question is how long.\\n(5) As you know, Abbas\\' position is crumbling. Based on my conversation with him when he was here recently, I\\nthink he is genuinely committed to an agreement. He hopes that, if this fails, Bibi will seem to be\\nunreasonable. And in that event, I expect he will resign. His minimal requirement is the equivalent of 1967.\\nThis is all tricky business, but I don\\'t think we have a responsible choice not to make this effort. It is the highest form of\\nstatesmanship for you to try.\\nI am leaving on Monday for some foreign travel but can be reached through my office -- Laura\\nHuber\\nSandyRoger.

Off-shore/on-shore balancing seeks to achieve America\\'s core national security\\nobjectives through a combination of over-the-horizon (\"off-shore\") military power and in-region (\"on-shore\") economic and\\npolitical power. Off-shore/on-shore balancing is an alternative to advancing U.S. security goals through the deployment of\\nlarge ground forces overseas, already problematic and likely to become even more so as economic challenges continue\\nand chronic resentment deepens. Off-shore/on-shore balancing relies on naval, air, and rapidly deployable ground forces\\nin combination with on-site economic and political support for local partners to secure America\\'s interests in combating\\nterrorism and achieving other key national security goals, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.\"\\nAMWe miss you!Verveer, Melanne S <VerveerMS@state.gov>\\nFriday, December 17, 2010 3:04 PM\\nNew Development\\nB1\\n1.4(D)\\nI have alerted Moriarty and Blake.\\nMelanne S.

Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton\\nfor proving that you don\\'t need to be president to act presidential.\\nFORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK\\nSECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON\\nSpeaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:\\n\"After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say\\nit clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century.\"\\nIronically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and\\nthe ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.\\nExcept that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill\\'s Clinton Global\\nInitiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself,\\nbringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic\\nsolutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to\\nrebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he\\'s a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he\\nspent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.\\nMeanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an\\naccolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin\\'s\\ntemper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women\\'s rights over the\\nobjections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world\\'s\\npoorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and\\nDevelopment Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is\\nwhat Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on.\\n74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughter\\nfor setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.\\nPOLICY PLANNING CHIEFS, DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTON\\nBarack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how the\\nUnited States deals with its allies and enemies abroad, and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes fell\\nlargely to two people in particular. At the State Department, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning, is\\nspearheading the department\\'s Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenate\\nmarginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, preparing for a world in\\nwhich America\\'s worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.\\nSlaughter\\'s Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy, co-founder of the Center for a New\\nAmerican Security think tank, who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that both\\ncandidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon\\'s own\\nquadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediate\\nneeds posed by today\\'s asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama\\'s Afghanistan\\nstrategy, albeit a pragmatic one: \"I don\\'t want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy,\" she told\\nthe Senate in February. \"We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better.\"\\nAnne-Marie Slaughter\\nDirector of Policy Planning\\nU.S. Dept(silent of State\\n(202) 647-2972Here is a quite different picture of the Middle East — and an example of our leading in a different way.

She would succeed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), who has served as\\nchairwoman since 2006.\\n\"Congresswoman Granger is interested in continuing on as chair of the state and foreign operations appropriations\\nsubcommittee,\" Matt LeffingwelL her press secretary, toldThe Cable Wednesday.\\nWhen power switches in Congress, a complicated game of musical chairs begins as senior members jockey for\\ncommittee and subcommittee chairs. Just being the highest-ranking minority member on a panel doesn\\'t mean one\\nautomatically takes over the chairmanship.\\nBut if Granger does succeed Lowey, she will play a large role in writing the bills that appropriate money for State\\nDepartment operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, and many other\\nthings. Those accounts all face unprecedented pressure next year as the GOP led Congress will be looking for\\nspending cuts that don\\'t have strong domestic constituencies.\\nLast month, we identified Granger as one of 10 Republicans who stand to be influential in the next Congress if\\nthe GOP won control of the House. Since then, we\\'ve received several e-mails from sources who had heard that\\nGranger would forgo the subcommittee chairmanship to pursue leadership of another panel.\\nWe\\'ve heard that Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), the third-ranking Republican on the panel, was eyeing the\\nchairmanship with the expectation that Granger would step aside.\\n(Mark Kirk (R-IL), the second-ranking Republican on the subcommittee, was elected Tuesday night to become the\\njunior senator from Illinois, the seat once held by Barack Obama.)\\nSo how would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle the responsibility of writing the State and foreign ops\\nappropriations bill? Here\\'s what we reported in October:\\nAlthough [Granger] supported the bill put forth this year by current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.),\\nshe criticizedthe increases for the foreign-ops budget, saying, \"We also face the continued concern in\\nour own country about our economy and the devastating effects of skyrocketing deficits and debt.\" She\\'s\\na strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which doesn\\'t bode well for foreign-aid\\nfunding in this dismal fiscal environment.\\nGranger also serves on the defense subcommittee, placing her at the intersection of the debate over how\\nto balance the national security budget and shift resources from defense to diplomacy and development.\\nHere she seems to favor the Pentagon, saying in June, \"I want to be sure that we aren\\'t increasing foreign\\naid at the expense of our troops.\" Her lack of support of international organizations was criticized by the\\ngroup Citizens for Global Solutions, which gave her an \"F\" in its 2007to 2009 rating. Granger is also\\non board with efforts to eliminate aid to countries that are not performing on internal reform, as she\\nexplained when expressing opposition to funding of the Senegalese government through the State\\nDepartment\\'s Millennium Challenge Corporation. \"We can\\'t just give out money and say we will put up\\nwith whatever you are doing,\" she said.\\nThe committee leadership assignments won\\'t be doled out for at least two to three weeks, our Hill sources report.\\nBut if Granger\\'s bid is successful, she\\'ll be instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State and Foreign Ops bill still has\\nnot been completed by Congress, despite that the fiscal year began Oct. 1.\\nThe stop gap funding measure that has been funding these programs since then, known as a \"continuing\\nresolution,\" expires in December. The lame duck Democratic led Congress is unlikely to be able to pass full\\nappropriations bills on its way out the door, so they will likely pass another short term continuing resolution. That\\nwould leave the final work on the actual bill to the incoming class led by the GOP next year.\\nYou are subscribed to email updates from The Cable Email delivery powered by Google\\nTo stop receiving these emails, you may unsubscribe now.\\nGoogle Inc., 20 West Kinzie, Chicago IL USA 60610Republican challenger Bill Brady is expected to concede defeat to,Democratic Gov.

After passing the Senate unanimously, there\\nwas every expectation that it would fly through the House on suspension. How this too became an abortion issue is truly\\ndistressing. We have our work more than cut out for us.\\nOn another note, i ran into Ray and Shaista the other night. They were recently in Pakistan and stayed with Zardari the\\nwhole time. It might make sense for someone to brief Ray. Zardari considers him his informal ambassador to the US.\\nz..L ;; ;•=r-i e forc,; e\\nPosted: i7 Dec 2010 03:08 PM PS\\'\\nIncoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman ileana Ros-Lehtinen. (R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening that\\nwould have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns about\\nthe legislation\\'s cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road that\\nthe °barna administration will face in advancing its women\\'s rights and foreign aid agenda during the next\\nCongressional session.\\nNon-governmental organizations, women\\'s rights advocates, and. lawmakers from both parties spent years\\ndeveloping and lobbying for the \"International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010,\" which\\nthe House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, for it and only 166\\nvoted against, because House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under \"suspension of the rules.\" This\\nprocedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the disadvantage of\\nrequiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage.\\n; Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill.\\nfailed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans. including\\nAppropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee member\\nRoger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS).\\nif passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance \"to prevent the incidence of child\\nmarriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legal\\nempowerment of girls and women.\" It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-year\\nstrategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annual\\nevaluation of countries\\' human rights practices.\\nSo what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6\"\\nshe objected to the Post of the bill, which would be Si.08 million over five years, and criticized it for not\\nproviding an accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The \\'\\nsaid the bill would authorize $1o8 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to\\n2015.\\nRos-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheet\\ngDF.), organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen\\'s bill removed the implementation\\nprocedures that gave the legislation teeth. \"Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actual\\nimplementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact,\"\\nthey wrote.\\nRegardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not come out\\nagainst it. But about one hour before the vote, every Republican House office received a message on the bill\\nfrom GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership Nyould vote \"no\" on the bill and encouraging all\\nRepublicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters.\\n\"There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts to\\ncombat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws,\" the alert read.\\nThe bill doesn\\'t contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already\\n; prohibited by what\\'s known as the almenè\" which has been boiler plate language in appropriations\\nbills since 1973.\\nInvoking the abortion issue sent the bill\\'s supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stunt,\\nconsidering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not have\\nan impact on the abortion issue.\\nRep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeat\\nthe forced child marriage act in a floor speech .Friday morning.\\n\"Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty McCollum\\n(D-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies that are\\ncoercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so they\\'re not forced into marriage\\nat the age of 12 and 13,\" LaTourette said. \"Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didn\\'t work people\\nhad to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I\\'m a Republican. I\\'m glad we beat their butt in the\\nelection, but there comes a time when, enough is enough.\"\\nBut it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron Schoch,\\n(R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the House and Ros-Lehtinen will\\ncontrol the Foreign Affairs committee.\\nThe main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill failed\\nin the House.\\n-The action on the House floor stopping the Child \\'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women.\\nand girls around the world,\" Durbin said in a Thursday statement. \"These.voung girls, enslaved in marriage, will be\\nbrutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continue\\nthis barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill.\"\\nFor the NGO and women\\'s advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than just this\\nbill. They also saw Republicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence Against\\nWomen Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the \"Mexico City Policy,\" which would\\nprevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion.\\n\"Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor, we\\'re going to see a debate\\nlike the one we just saw,\" said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. \"It\\'s hard to imagine how any\\ndevelopment bills are going to pass in this environment.\"\\nThe protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised to elevate\\nthe issue Thursday when rolling out the State Department\\'s Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She\\nhas said that forced child marriage is \"a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights\", and that \"the\\nDepartment of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse\".\\nState\\'s Ambassador at Large for Global Women\\'s Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behind\\nthe scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bill\\'s supporters said that the administration was\\nnowhere to be found. In October, the White House decided to waive all penalties under the Child Soldiers\\nPrevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports.\\nUnited Nations Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between the\\nages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council,\\nreproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if current\\ntrends continue.\\n!\\nOne of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?• :) is\\nthe Pakistani militasy\\'s failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan\\'s tribal areas as a safe\\n- haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan.\\nPakistan • a major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, against extremists in South\\nWaziristan in October 2009, and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other border\\nareas. However, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan, where insurgent\\ngroups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside.\\nPakistan\\'s envoy in Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan will\\nengage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan, including the •Hartgani network (no relation), but only when there is\\nsufficient support in all areas of Pakistan\\'s government for the effort, and not until they are confident that the\\nmission can be completed effectively.\\n\"Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as a\\nmodern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country,\" Haqqani said in an exclusive\\ninterview with The Cable. \"But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to success.\"\\nHaqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan in\\nwhich domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply not in a\\nposition to expand its war on the extremists now.\\n\"Right now, it\\'s only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged in\\ndealing with flood relief work,\" he said. \"We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the country,\\nand those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period.\"\\nHe also noted that \"there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements,\"\\nand that Pakistan\\'s government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on a\\ntimeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones.\\n\"Sometimes it\\'s easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makes\\ndecisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities,\" Haqqani said.\\nIn several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position on\\nattacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is being\\nunrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan-\\nPakistan border, which have existed for decades.\\n, \"There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and done\\ntheir way,\" another Pakistani government official said.\\n; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much of\\nthe blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the \\'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.\\n\\'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions such\\nas speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and providing\\nPakistan the means for large scale operations,\" the official said.\\nThe United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support its\\nwar against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterize\\nas the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan\\'s severe problems.\\n\"It\\'s very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan,\" one Pakistani official said.\\nIn remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review Thursday, President Obama was diplomatic when\\ndiscussing his administration\\'s ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan.\\n\"Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to all\\nour countries, especially Pakistan. We\\'ve welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will\\ncontinue to help strengthen Pakistanis\\' capacity to root out terrorists,\" said Obama. \"Nevertheless, progress has not\\ncome fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders\\nmust be dealt with.\"\\nUndersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that there\\nwas more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. and\\nNATO-led mission in Afghanistan.\\n\"Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment,\" she said. \"Their\\ncalculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategic\\npartnership.\"\\nThe White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. \"The bottom line is that Pakistan is a country\\nwhere we have little influence, little access and little credibility,\" one of Obama\\'s aides to■..-:), The New York Times.\\nThe administration\\'s official line, therefore, is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity to its\\nclaim that they simply can\\'t expand their war against extremists at this time.\\n\"We would like them to move tomorrow, we would like them to take out these people tomorrow,\" the new U.S.\\nAmbassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. \"But we understand they\\'re telling us honestly about the capacity of\\ntheir military, and when they are able, we are convinced they will move in.\"\\nBut for many in Washington, the open-ended delay in Pakistan.s promise to expand military operations into North.\\nWaziristan represents a strategic choice, and is not just a result of the military\\'s operational limitations.

Sid\\naary\\'s Homerun of a Speech\\nby Tunku Varadarajan\\nSeptember 8, 2010 I 12:16pm\\nClinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in Washington,\\n,\\nDC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obama\\nadministration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her \"new American moment\"—and why she\\'s\\nbetter than her boss.\\nBehold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm,\\nunfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.\\nIn the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech\\nWednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first time we have been\\ngiven an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereas\\nher president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that\\nAmerica is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living \"a new American\\nmoment—a moment when our global leadership is essential.\" There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; there\\nwas, instead, a promise that \"we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home and\\nabroad.\"\\nWhat is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary\\nwould have made a much, much better president than Obama.\\nTry this for size: \"The United States can, must and will lead in the new century.\" In order to do that, Clinton promised \"a\\nnew global architecture,\" \"built to last and withstand stress.\" And in a muscular departure from the way in which this\\nadministration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American\\nvalues, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: \"Democracy needs defending.\"\\nX\\nHuman rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow \"the rules of the road\" in its\\naspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar\\nworld, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.\\nClinton used phrases like \"American might,\" words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—words\\nthat we\\'ve come to believe that many Democrats can\\'t bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into\\na vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.\\nHillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for \"good, old-fashioned diplomacy,\" and\\nthere certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it\\nshould be noted, is in contrast to Obama\\'s apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit\\nbigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton\\'s \"old-fashioned\" diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premise\\nthat America is the world\\'s leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.\\nIn her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of \"American might.\" The first, of course, is \"economic power.\" But it is her\\nhailing of the second—America\\'s \"moral authority\"—that was so invigorating.\\nIt was Acheson who said: \"The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state\\nis that they both understand who is president.\" What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain to\\nbehold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much,\\nmuch better president than Obama.\\nTunku Varadarajan is a national affairs correspondent and writer at large for The Daily Beast.

For example, we now know statutorily that S/CT legislatively is a\\nrequired S report).\\nThat said, here is her narrative for your review for when we speak. I have embedded comments in caps in text after\\neach graph where relevant.\\nTO: Anne-Marie Slaughter\\nFROM: Melanne Verveer\\nDATE: November 4, 2010\\nRE: Gender Integration in the QDDR\\nThe Secretary has declared time and time again that the empowerment of women is \"at the heart of the foreign\\npolicy of the United States.\" Our collective task is to realize this principle by integrating gender into the policies and\\nprograms of the State Department and USAID in an enduring way.\\nWe are concerned that the current draft of the QDDR falls short of this call. In the existing draft, the Office of\\nGlobal Women\\'s Issues falls under a new Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights while\\nretaining the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\\'s Issues who reports directly to the Secretary. This new structure\\nmisses the simple but important reality that women are half of the world\\'s population and that the major security,\\neconomic and social challenges of this century cannot be solved without them. These issues cut across the work of the\\ndepartment and touch virtually all regions, though we place special emphasis on regions in which women and girls\\nare most vulnerable, such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition. Locating the office within one bureau\\nmakes it impossible for the Office to implement its very charge — to integrate gender effectively into the work of the\\nentire State Department.\\nTherefore, gender must be integrated throughout all of the regional and functional bureaus rather than located\\nwithin one bureau. Women should be integral to all of our diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral and multilateral\\nrelationships, strategic dialogues, and public diplomacy, to our relations with civil society, community leaders and other\\nnon-state actors. Women are also important to consider in all of our policy initiatives, including global health, food\\nsecurity, climate change, economic issues, human rights, and peace and security. We must institute rigorous\\ninstitutional mechanisms to ensure that all bureaus, both regional and functional, consider gender in diplomacy and\\ndevelopment.\\nIn order to integrate gender effectively throughout the work of the Department, we recommend the following\\napproach to planning, budgeting, structure and evaluation:\\nMaintain visibility and focus on gender. Retain the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\\'s Issues who\\nreports to the Secretary. This position embodies our commitment to and advocacy for gender equality as an essential\\npart of diplomacy and development and signals our understanding that this is important to the national security of the\\nUnited States. In addition, the office advances a coherent and coordinated strategy on gender throughout the State\\nDepartment and USAID. [DONE]\\nEnsure that gender is effectively addressed throughout all bureaus and missions. We recommend the\\nfollowing structural changes at State. First, make the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) in all regional and\\nfunctional bureaus responsible and accountable for their bureaus\\' work on gender. The Office of Global Women\\'s Issues\\nwould serve as a resource to the PDAS on these issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons to regional bureaus\\nfor purposes of integration, where needed. Third, include training and capacity development for employees on gender\\nIssues (in both Foreign and Civil Service as well as for political appointees). Fourth, evaluate the PDAS in each bureau on\\ngender integration in policies and programs (including, for example, as a component in the Performance Evaluation\\nSystem). Similarly, require each Chief of Mission to be responsible and accountable for the mission\\'s work on gender, to\\nassign personnel with expertise to manage the work on gender, to require personnel to receive training on gender\\nissues, and to be evaluated on this work. A parallel structure should be put in place at USAID, and our diplomacy and\\ndevelopment work on gender should be coordinated and complimentary.\\n[THIS IS RECOMMENDATION, WITH SOME VARIATION, MADE FOR MANY AREAS — PUBLIC DIPLOMACY,\\nMULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND OTHERS — CHALLENGE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY HOW TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY AND CREAT A\\nPDAS JOB THAT IS MEANINGFUL GIVEN THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOUGHT TO BE IMPOSED THROUGH THAT\\nPOSITION]\\nInclude gender in strategic planning and budget allocation. We recommend continuing the requirement\\ninitiated last year that all bureaus include a plan for gender integration in their annual Strategic Plan and Budget\\nproposal. Each bureau is required to describe how their policies and programs will improve gender equality and how\\nthat will strengthen their work more generally. They are also required, to the extent possible, to outline what portion of\\ntheir policies and programs target or affect women and girls. [THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED]\\nMeasure impact. Develop indicators and long-term evaluation systems to measure the impact of programs on\\nwomen and girls. There are efforts underway currently within F and at USAID to consider how to improve our\\nmeasurement of impact on women and girls and to develop different and additional indicators where\\nappropriate.

All 50 are candidates right now. They all want to be\\ncandidates for mayor and why not? This the best job in America, right here.\"\\nIn the anteroom behind the City Council chambers, the scene was controlled chaos as more than a dozen\\naldermen — white, black and Latino — happily stepped out of the meeting to give interviews to anyone who\\nwanted to listen about how they could be the city\\'s next mayor.\\nBut the prospective candidates — following the old political adage that it\\'s \"better to be looked over than\\noverlooked\" — weren\\'t limited to City Hall.\\nIn Washington, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was touted by another Chicagoan, President Barack\\nObama\\'s political guru David Axelrod, as having the skills and personality to be a big-city mayor.\\nAmid all the early jockeying, bluffing and bullying, veteran Aid. Richard Mell, 33rd, outlined the nuts and bolts\\nreality of mounting a mayoral campaign with only weeks before the Nov. 22 deadline for submitting petitions.\\n\"Someone\\'s got to have some serious money. This isn\\'t something you just decide,\" Mel! said. \"It takes a full-\\nscale ward-by-ward operation to identify your votes and get them out to vote.\"\\nMell also talked about the qualities to look for in a winning candidate — someone who will be a \"unifier\" and\\n\"can\\'t be looked at as looking at one segment of the city.\"\\nStill, many politicians were beginning their assessment by gauging the mood of their political base.\\n\"I don\\'t know if it\\'s as important that it\\'s an African-American candidate as it is about a candidate that is going\\nto be fair to the African-American community,\" said Aid. Walter Burnett, 27th, head of the council\\'s black\\ncaucus, which met in private at the Hotel Allegro across from City Hall.\\n\"For anyone to run for mayor of the city of Chicago there has to be a groundswell of people in the city to\\nsupport them ...

Bobby Rush, a South Side Democrat, said\\nit was \"critical\" to try to find an African-American contender who would work for the black community\\'s\\ninterests. But the council\\'s black caucus agreed only to try to come up with a list of topics, such as improving\\neducation, that prospective candidates should address.\\nLatino council members met for lunch and agreed to meet again within the next few weeks, giving potential\\ncandidates time to develop a presentation to make to them.\\n\"If there\\'s a Hispanic that runs, he or she will probably get the majority of the Hispanic vote,\" said Ald. Danny\\nSolis, 25th.\\n\"I think more than likely it probably, if you look at the numbers, it won\\'t be a Hispanic in the runoff,\" Solis said.\\n\"But then I think we can play a very important role\" in backing one of the remaining candidates.\\nBut such sentiments didn\\'t deter one of the city\\'s most prominent Latino politicians from declaring that he plans\\nto run. City Clerk Miguel del Valle told the Tribune he planned to make a formal announcement \"down the\\nroad.\"\\nMell and many others expect the field for the February city election will be too fragmented for any candidate to\\nreach the winning margin of 50 percent plus one vote. If there is no outright winner, the top two vote-getters\\nproceed to an April 5 runoff election.\\nOne prominent Northwest Side committeeman, who asked not to be identified because of the early stage of the\\ncampaigns, said the measure of those candidates who are real and those who are seeking an ego boost can be\\nmeasured in two numbers: 25,000 and $7 million.\\nThough 12,500 signatures are needed for the February primary, politicians routinely get double the number to\\nensure they make the ballot. As for $7 million, the committeeman said, about $4 million would be needed to\\nensure a first or second place finish on Feb. 22, followed by a campaign of about $3 million for the April runoff.\\n\"I\\'m getting a lot of calls about having lunch,\" said the committeeman. \"I\\'ve told them to call me back when\\nthey get the signatures and then we can talk about fundraising.\"\\nAid. Patrick Levar, 45th, who is not running for mayor, said this power vacuum reminds him of when Mayor\\nHarold Washington died and Eugene Sawyer was picked to replace him.\\n\"There\\'s a lot of people who are going to be jockeying for position, but I\\'ve learned over the years to sit and\\nlisten and see who can put the different coalitions together,\" said Levar, who is also the Northwest Side ward\\'s\\nDemocratic committeeman. \"Whoever can raise the amount of money and put the coalition together is the\\nperson who is going to win.\"\\nWhile many politicians were starting those discussions, some key Democratic committeemen said they hadn\\'t\\nheard from Emanuel, one of the most prominent potential candidates.\\nEmanuel, a former top political aide to Daley and Northwest Side congressman, has previously said he\\'d like to\\nbe mayor but has avoided the spotlight since Daley\\'s announcement.\\nRobert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expected Emanuel\\nto \"take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future.\"\\nBut Axelrod, who previously served as Daley\\'s political adviser, told ABC News that if Emanuel decided\\nto leave the White House for a mayoral bid, \"the president will support that decision.\"\\nSaying mayors are \"larger than life personalities,\" Axelrod said Emanuel \"has that combination of skills and\\nthat personality and mindset to be a success if he chooses to go that route.\"Importance: High\\nFyiMcHale, Judith A <McHaleJA@state.gov>\\nThursday, September 9, 2010 10:07 AM\\nMills, Cheryl D; Sullivan, Jacob J; Reines, Philippe I\\nFW: (AFP) Pastor says may halt Koran burning if White House asks\\nAs we just discussed, below is the quote I referred to from pastor in Florida.\\nLet me know if you need me to do anything else.\\njmMore, original story.been released\\nReza teghavi\\nBusinessman from Los angeles jailed in same prison as hikers since 2008.

Paid TV ads, please. Sid\\nSeptember 11,2010\\nG.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists\\nBy ERIC LIPTON\\nWASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory\\noverhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry\\nlobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.\\nThe bill\\'s passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street\\nlobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water\\nit down.\\n\"We need you to get out there and speak up against this,\" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three\\npeople familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.\\nThat sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual\\nfor Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He\\nmaintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation\\'s biggest\\nbusinesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.\\nThey have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their\\ncorporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for\\nhis Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.\\nSome of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office\\'s help — calling the congressman and his aides as\\noften as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped\\nthem out.\\nAs Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party — President Obama\\nmentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,\\ncultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.\\nThe woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met \"countless times with\\nspecial-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation\" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.\\nAnd the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he \"epitomizes the\\nsmoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.\"\\nMr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically\\nmotivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that\\nhe has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small\\nplastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.\\n\"I get lobbied every day by somebody,\" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. \"It could be by my wife. It could be\\nthe bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace.\"\\nMr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as Newt\\nGingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his\\nreputation as a \"Chamber of Commerce\" Republican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million for\\nRepublican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise.\\nIf elected as his party\\'s leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds\\ncoalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong\\nwith that.\\n\"Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely,\" said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm\\nrepresents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse\\nas Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. \"But I think all the good lawmakers do.\"\\nMr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobacco\\nlobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said he had\\nbroken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other Republicans\\' campaigns.\\nHis business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed the\\nThursday Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party\\'s\\nlegislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadership\\nposition.\\nBut he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and the\\nWorkforce Committee, and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regulars,\\nalong with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner\\'s office for client matters,\\nwrite checks to his campaign and socialize with him.\\nThat tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, a\\nCitigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists.\\nThe tobacco industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. Reynolds,\\nmaker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr.\\nBoehner\\'s political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner\\'s\\npolitical career, according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.\\nWhile many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporate\\ninterests, Mr. Boehner\\'s ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The\\nmembers of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff.\\n\"He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it,\" said Drew Maloney, a\\nlobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. \"That is how you get things done.\"\\nOne lobbyist in the club — after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner\\'s office that he routinely calls to ask for help —\\nticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker\\'s backing: combating fee increases for the oil\\nindustry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a cap\\non greenhouse gas emissions.\\nStill, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights.\\nBut despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.\\nFrom 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided by\\ncompanies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)\\nIn addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often to\\npopular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently been\\ncurbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.\\nMr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid for\\nthrough his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the Ritz\\nCarlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 at\\nthe Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events.\\nIn June, with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising, Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-\\nraising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to draw\\nlarge donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.\\nHe turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of the\\nRepublican National Committee.\\n\"The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates,\" Mr. Boehner told his supporters,\\none of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. \"But I don\\'t want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because\\nwe have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money.\"\\nMr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raised\\nnearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidates\\nacross the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.\\nThe Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like \"meetings with\\nLeader Boehner and much much more.\"\\nBut his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty of\\naccess to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House.\\n\"He knows this is going to be a tough election,\" said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clients\\ninclude Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. \"But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril.\"FYIpaymasters\\nFYIof an issue, Boehner would compromise on tax-cut extension -- NYT softens Boehner\\nwording after aide complains -- Maureen Dowd\\'s sister, Peggy, may switch from Obama\\nto RO...\\nBREAKING — DNC goes up on national cable Tuesday with an ad on \"The Boehner plan.\" A\\nDNC official says it\\'ll be up a little less than a week: \\'This ad is one product we\\'ll use to\\ndefine Mr. Boehner, his ethics and priorities for the American people - and there will be others.\"\\nYou Tube http://bit.ly/dB6Yb1\\nROBERT GIBBS (*PressSec) tweets on the NYT front-pager on House Republican\\nLeader John Boehner: \"Headline says it all.. .A G.O.P.

But I\\'m going to do\\neverything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans.\"\\nA Boehner aide reads between the lines: \"Despite what Obama says, Republicans are not\\nholding middle-class tax cuts hostage and we\\'re not going to let him get away with those types of\\nfalse claims. Our focus remains on getting bipartisan support for a freeze on all current rates,\\nbecause that is what is best for the economy and small business job creation. Boehner\\'s words\\nwere calculated to deprive Obama of the ability to continue making those false claims, and as a\\nresult we are in a better position rhetorically to pressure more Democrats to support a full\\nfreeze.\"\\nAN INSTANT CLASSIC:\\nSchieffer: \"Mr. Boehner, I\\'m going to ask you this question because I\\'m not objective about this\\n- I\\'m a cancer survivor, I used to be a heavy smoker.

Democrats think they can get away with their job-killing agenda by ramming it down people\\'s\\nthroats, excluding opposing viewpoints and eliminating fair debate. They are turning their backs on American families\\nand businesses as they continue to tax, borrow and spend into oblivion. John Boehner and the Republicans believe\\ngovernment should reflect the priorities of the American people--priorities that have been ignored, even mocked by the\\npowers-that-be in Washington. Obama, Pelosi and Reid must be stopped from raising taxes on any American during a\\nrecession and spending money we don\"t have on big government programs no one wants.

Allawi said he pulled back from striking a deal with ISCI because he is concerned that the Shia representation is\\ntoo small and there is too much difficulty in trying to widen\\n2. Allawi asked bill if he thought Maliki was serious, suggesting that he was toying with the idea of a grand coalition\\n3. Allawi will see Barzani on the 11th\\nBill\\'s overall take is that Allawi might now be looking to test the wider coalition proposition and is not as interested in\\nthe ISCI gambit as first option.\\nBill has also seen AI-Mahdi Talabani and Zebari. He said there would be a good meeting with Maliki he\\'s obviously\\nfeeling confident, but was firm on limiting role of Sadrists and need to bring Iraqiyya into inclusive govt.You asked about this.

Through constant innovation and technical evolution, our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway for\\naudiences in China and Iran.\"\\n\"We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom,\" Isaacson said. \"Wherever there is a firewall, it\\'s our duty\\nto storm it, to denounce it and to circumvent it.\"\\nIsaacson was speaking at last week\\'s 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe, which he credited as\\ncontributing to the end of the Cold War. He made it clear the BBG\\'s outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively,\\neven if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration.\\n\"It\\'s sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it\\'s\\ntasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all, covering the news with the highest journalistic\\nstandards and secondly, being a part of America\\'s public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the\\nworld,\" Isaacson said.\\n\"Let me say to you, my fellow journalists, that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions,\\nour mission of being credible journalists, because in fact, it\\'s the only way to carry out the second mission. You can\\'t do\\nit unless you\\'re credible and telling the truth, and in the end, the truth is on our side.\"\\nPressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means, especially in light of reports that the Obama administration\\nsought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised he wouldn\\'t\\nhesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations.\\nHe said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent of\\nthe time -- as for the other 10 percent, a choice must be made.\\n\"I feel it\\'s the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism, just as you would in the\\nprivate sector,\" Isaacson said. \"We can never compromise our credibility. And in doing so, that will probably help further\\nthe foreign policy interests of the United States. But if it\\'s ever a real conflict, our goal one is to protect our credibility.\"Great news.

She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on Foreign\\nRelations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound.\\nBy EMILY PARKER\\nIn 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,\\nsurrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to\\ndiscuss why he believes that literature can change the world.\\nMr. Vargas Llosa\\'s Nobel Prize is a great victory—and not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is\\nperhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,\\nor who claim that they have \"no time\" for fiction.\\nIn a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature \"an important place in the life\\nof nations.\" He wrote, \\'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best\\nprotector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.\"\\nMr. Vargas Llosa\\'s novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value\\nof individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he\\nis among the most successful.\\nColumnist Mary Anastasia O\\'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.\\nA case in point is \"Conversation in the Cathedral,\" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue\\nfirst from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which\\nis when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how\\ndictatorships impregnate \"every act of life.\"\\nTo demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book\\nopens with a grim landscape of \"uneven and faded buildings\" and describes \"dull and defeated eyes at the\\ntables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer.\" The narrative, which rapidly jumps from\\npast to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You don\\'t know who to trust.\\nMr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in \"The Feast of the Goat,\" which explicitly details the horrors of\\nthe Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women, and\\nso we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path. \"The\\nwoman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship,\" Mr. Vargas Llosa told me.\\nFor some, Mr. Vargas Llosa\\'s victory will be controversial because of his political background and his\\noutspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran for president of Peru in 1990, losing to Alberto Fujimori. During the\\ncampaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy, free trade and private\\nproperty. He was no less controversial for his support of the invasion of Iraq, which he saw as necessary to\\nending what he called the \"monstrous dictatorship\" of Saddam Hussein.\\nMr. Vargas Llosa has now left politics, and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen. Or as\\nhe told me in Lima: \\'Through writing, one can change history.\"\\nNot all of his work is dark. \"Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\" is punctuated with humor, and \\'The Bad Girl,\" about\\none man\\'s world-wide pursuit of an elusive lover, is a thoroughly entertaining read. The one constant is a\\nperceptive and empathetic glimpse into a wide range of human experience.\\nAs Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote in his 2001 essay about literature, \"Nothing better protects a human being against\\nthe stupidity of prejudice, racism, religious or political sectarianism, and exclusivist nationalism than this truth\\nthat invariably appears in great literature: that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal.\"\\nMs. Parker is an international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.Can you also send me Rocco\\'s #?sbwhoeo1\\nFriday, 0c\\n3 10 4:08 PM\\nH: The Boehner poll. Sid\\nraw Westen\\nPsychologist and neuroscientist; Emory University Professor\\nPosted: October 8, 2010 09:23 AM\\ndJnLM L t\\n,\\n-.\\n-1.117.=1MIC2VAILISIrie ll=a===.1\\nAccording to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model John Boehner will give his \"closing\\nargument\" to the American people on why they should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid \"job-\\nkilling agenda.\" He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venue\\nthese days for a man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks\\nand the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at other clubs with industry\\nlobbyists.\\nEither the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans\\nbelieve it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to put Boehner\\'s\\nface on what a Republican majority might look like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech.\\nI have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner\\nhas minimal name recognition among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.\\nFirst, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most Republicans in the news, he has not\\nbeen well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first\\nrather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican were the GOP to assume\\ncontrol over the House (other than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in\\nWashington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a story, and other than\\nperhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner\\'s tanned\\nvisage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington\\n(including his stint as the Marlboro Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the\\nfloor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican\\'s bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.\\nI remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I conducted a national\\n5urye:y with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely voting\\npopulations. The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and\\nstandard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were surprisingly similar whether\\nwe looked at registered voters or likely voters, although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a\\n\"likely voter\" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to change\\nthe dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.)\\nAs detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well worth defining, who readily\\nstands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for\\nCongressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swing\\nvoters). We tested both paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of\\nthose narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we could test them against:\\nthe words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in defining the \"Obama-Pelosi-Reid\" agenda.\\nWhat we found, in brief: is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the \"job-killing\" socialists in the White House\\nand Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actor\\ngoing in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-long\\ndescriptions of \"what\\'s the matter with Boehner\" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough conservative\\nattack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.\\nThe narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by double-digits over tough\\nRepublican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street\\nexecutives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of\\nWashington by corporate special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political\\nspectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove\\ninto the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic voters.\\nIn some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line statements of what we need in a Speaker and\\nwho John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely reflect the\\npower of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and\\naspirational (e.g., \"We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans\" -- a theme\\ncolleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the role of money in politics) --\\nto the harder-edged (e.g., \"The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know\\nwhere John Boehner\\'s heart is, and it isn\\'t with the middle class,\" or \"John Boehner understands deficits. He\\'s spent\\nnearly 20 years in Washington creating them.\")\\nIf there\\'s a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want\\nto hang onto their seats in November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle class and small\\nbusiness versus the billionaires and big corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child\\nfor the party whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and to avoid\\ngiving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they\\nstand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on\\nboth sides of the aisle.\\nIn the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the last two years was the\\nfailure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the\\nfailure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of faded Republican economic principles. Two years ago,\\nthat was a virtually uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White House and\\nsupermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the middle as to who caused the recession.\\nReality doesn\\'t brand itself. Hopefully it won\\'t take a debacle in November and another 10 million jobs lost for reality to\\nunveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.That\\'s what I thought too.

Put Boehner in this\\nblitzkrieg. Sid\\nWhy is This GOP House Candidate Dressed as\\na Nazi?\\nBy Joshua Green\\nAn election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott, the\\nRepublican nominee for Congress from Ohio\\'s 9th District, and a Tea Party favorite, who for years donned a German\\nWaffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments.\\nRich lott, second from right, in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform.\\nlott, whose district lies in Northwest Ohio, was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking, whose members are devoted\\nto re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division, the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which fought mainly on the\\nEastern Front during World War 11. lott\\'s participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign\\'s website, and\\nhis name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed his\\ninvolvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does not\\nsubscribe to the tenets of Nazism. \"No, absolutely not,\" he said. \"In fact, there\\'s a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. And\\nyou\\'ll find that on almost any reenactment website. it\\'s purely historical interest in World War II.\"\\nRich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website.\\nlott, a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, added, \"I\\'ve always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively\\nsmall country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most of\\nEurope and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical military\\npoint of view, that\\'s incredible.\"\\nlott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the Russian\\nArmy, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group\\'s website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitment\\nvideo, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.\\nThe website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference to\\nthe \"twisted\" nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:\\nNazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives to\\nensure a \"New and Free Europe\", free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -\\nmany in Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as the\\nprotector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quite\\ntwisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant men\\ndied defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; no\\nmatter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular the\\nforeign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.\\nHistorians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. \"These guys don\\'t know their history,\" said Charles\\nW. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of \"Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death\\'s Head Division, 1933-45,\"\\nwhich chronicles an SS division. \"They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what occurred.\" Sydnor added that re-\\nenactments like the Wiking group\\'s are illegal in Germany and Austria. \"If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germany\\ntoday, you\\'d be arrested.\"\\nSee web-only content:\\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/\\nChristopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, \"It is so unhistorical and\\nso apologetic that you don\\'t know to what degree they\\'ve simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts who\\nlove putting on uniforms.\"\\nloft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as\\n2003), but did so with his son \"as a father-son bonding thing.\" He says his name and pictures were removed from the\\nWiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years\\nago, after his son lost interest.\\nloft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias \"Reinhard Pferdmann,\" which has also been\\nremoved, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. \"Part of the reenactor\\'s [experience],\" lott said, \"is the\\nliving-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units\\nwhat individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based\\naround your own real experiences. \\'Reinhard\\' of course is \\'Richard\\' in German. And \\'Pferdmann,\"pferd\\' is a horse. So it\\'s\\nliterally \\'horse man.\"\\nAsked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor\\'s group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said he\\nhoped it would not: \"They have to take it in context. There\\'s reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn\\'t do Civil\\nWar re-enacting if somebody didn\\'t play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that\\'s definitely way in the past.\\n... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that\\'s strictly all.\"\\n0\\nlott at Nazi re-enactment.\\nRabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B\\'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district,\\ndisagreed. \"Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and\\ncertainly in poor taste, if not offensive,\" he said. \"I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the\\nJewish community, but the broader community.\"\\nIn a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups\\nbut made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: \"Never, in any of my reenacting of\\nmilitary history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the\\ntragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the\\nmilitary and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life.\" He added that\\nhe has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II\\nAmerican infantryman and paratrooper.\\nThe actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book \"The Death Marches of\\nHungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945,\" Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers\\nfrom the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to\\nAmerican forces in Austria.\\n\"What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but that\\'s kind of a dodge,\" says\\nProf. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. \"The\\nentire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of \\'subhumans,\\' Slays were going to be enslaved\\nin numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be\\nexterminated altogether. That\\'s what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think that\\npeople want to dress up and play SS on the weekend.\"\\nThis article available online at:\\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/\\nCopyright © 2010 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

Sid\\nThe Political Scene\\nConfounding Fathers\\nThe Tea Party\\'s Cold War roots.\\nby Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010\\nann Beck\\'s view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.\\nA few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite\\nprops: a pipe clenched between his teeth. \"I\\'ve got my pipe,\" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the\\nstem, \"because we\\'re going to speak about schoolish kind of things.\" The theme of the day was \"Restoring History,\" and\\nBeck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of\\nhistory textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by \"malicious progressive intent.\" Progressives, he\\nexplained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—\"knew they had to separate us from our\\nhistory to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God.\" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the\\nhistory that \"is being stolen from us\": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the\\nnation from the \"near-depression\" of 1946—crises that progressives don\\'t want you to know about. \"You\\'ve been taught\\none lie, I think, your whole life,\" he said.\\nFor the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon\\nconvert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by\\nDemocracy Corps, showed that he is \"the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,\" seen not merely\\nas an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an \"educator.\" And in the past few months Beck has established his own\\ninstitute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with\\n\"revisionists and secular progressives\" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist\\nfederal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the\\ndivision of powers.\\nDuring the \"Restoring History\" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear\\n\"lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find.\" The B.U. faculty consists of three\\nmembers, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at\\nLouisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,\\nwhich the Web site calls \"a national pro-family organization.\" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,\\non his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons\\nabout the country\\'s long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the\\nearly twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and\\nthe graduated federal income tax came into existence. \"Wilson,\" Beck told his radio audience in August, \"just despised\\nwhat America was.\"\\nBeck\\'s claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement\\'s Freedom\\nSummit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, \"The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow\\nWilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill.\" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from\\nCape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group\\'s Web site that \"the very things you see happening in this country today\\nstarted with the Wilson Administration.\"\\nAt a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as \"an\\nunfettered new force of the middle class.\" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is\\naudacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation\\'s long history of\\nconspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,\\nespecially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.\\nBeck\\'s version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.\\nCleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society\\'s founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,\\nof course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers\\' politics and their view of American\\nhistory—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist\\nChina—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades\\ninside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to\\nchallenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.\\nThe early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist\\nviolence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time\\ndeliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called\\n\"massive resistance\" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which\\nclaimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a\\nfearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he\\nresigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy\\'s Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing\\npropaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom\\nThurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly\\nliberal domestic programs \"fall clearly within the category of socialism.\"\\nThe John Birch Society was one of the decade\\'s most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert\\nWelch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-\\nintelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the\\nCold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy\\'s fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy\\'s\\nfollowers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society\\'s membership was\\nestimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an \"immense\"\\ndomestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists\\' clutches. In a tract\\ntitled \"The Politician,\" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as \"a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist\\nconspiracy\" who had been serving the plot \"all of his adult life.\" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he\\naccused the Kennedy Administration of \"helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the\\nopposite.\"\\nWherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of\\ntotalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik\\nRevolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as \"always and inevitably an\\nenemy of individual freedom.\" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government\\'s\\nrole in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson \"more than any other one\\nman started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.\"\\nIn the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but \"a tool of the total\\nconspiracy.\" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth\\ncentury, in the \"uniformly Satanic creed and program\" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called \"the Insiders,\" the\\nconspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government\\nagencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the\\nBilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they\\nhad done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. \"One broad avenue down which these\\nconspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,\" Welch declared in 1966. \"The very same collectivist\\ntheories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new\\nand modern concepts.\"\\nIn the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a\\nnonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the\\nMarxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the\\npopulace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. \"It isn\\'t numbers we have to worry about,\" Welch wrote, \"but the\\ncourage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.\"\\nThe \"Founder\" himself would dictate the society\\'s policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and\\nprofessionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. \"It is the leadership that is most\\ndemanding, most exacting of its followers,\" Welch observed, \"that achieves really dedicated support.\" Welch\\'s group\\nbecame synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly\\nto the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a\\nhumorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.\\nStill, the most outlandish of the era\\'s right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A\\ntransplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early\\nnineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover\\'s F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted\\nthat \"during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing \\'professional communists\\' who\\nare promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes.\" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,\\nfrom 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed\\nimplausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he\\nhad served as Hoover\\'s administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.\\nSkousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from\\n1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card\\ngame attended by the city\\'s right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen \"a master of half\\ntruths\" and said that he ran the police department \"like a Gestapo\"; Skousen\\'s supporters placed burning crosses on the\\nMayor\\'s lawn.\\nAfter losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an\\nexemplar of the far-right \"ultras.\" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion\\nSpeakers\\' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled \"The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,\" which\\ncondemned the society\\'s critics for \"promoting the official Communist Party line.\" (This was a tic of Skousen\\'s; he later\\ndefended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called \"The Communist Attack on the\\nMormons.\")\\nAll along, Skousen\\'s evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch\\'s. In \"The Naked Communist,\" a lengthy primer\\npublished in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.\\'s adviser\\nHarry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first\\nSputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon\\'s novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\"\\nappeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating \"a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds\\ncould be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters.\" A later book, \"The Naked Capitalist,\" decried the\\nIvy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller\\nFoundation, formed \"the world\\'s secret power structure.\" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like\\nthe wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the\\nFederal Reserve and the graduated income tax.\\nIn 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for\\nConstitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center\\'s targets\\nincluded \"the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal\\nCommunication Commission\\'s fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government\\'s change of the gold\\nstandard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social\\nsecurity, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.\"\\nSkousen\\'s pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing\\nfringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had \"gone\\noff the deep end.\" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of \"inventing fantastic ideas and\\nmaking inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,\" and advancing doctrines that came \"perilously\\nclose\" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations\\nand the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his\\norganizations.\\nSkousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced \"The 5,000 Year Leap,\" a treatise that assembles selective quotations\\nand groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that\\nthe framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often\\ndescribed as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander\\nHamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. \"The 5,000 Year Leap\" is not a fervid\\nbook. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of\\nwhat Samuel Adams, in 1768, called \"the Utopian schemes of leveling,\" which Skousen equates with redistribution of\\nwealth. But he does not mention the Founders\\' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas\\nJefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,\\nwhich meant that \"the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made\\na paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.\"\\nSkousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that \"the Founders were not indulging in any idle\\ngesture when they adopted the motto \\'In God We Trust.\\' \"In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional\\nConvention was \"E Pluribus Unum\": out of many, one. \"In God We Trust\" came much later; its use on coins was first\\npermitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.\\nThe following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved \"In God We Trust\" as\\nthe national motto.\\nIn 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,\" and\\nprepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative\\nstudy of Beck, \"Common Nonsense,\" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California\\nBicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from\\nlong-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as \"pickaninnies\" and\\nsuggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of\\nStanford, inspected Skousen\\'s book and seminars and pronounced them \"a joke that no self-respecting scholar would\\nthink is worth a warm pitcher of spit.\"\\nBy the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in\\n2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: \"The Naked Communist,\" \"The Naked Capitalist,\" and, especially, \"The 5,000\\nYear Leap,\" which he called \"essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did.\" After\\nBeck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—\\nit shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand\\ncopies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country\\nhave since organized study groups around it. \"It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding\\nFathers,\" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen\\'s book. If Beck is\\nthe movement\\'s teacher, \"The 5,000 Year Leap\" has become its primer, with \"The Making of America\" as a kind of 102-\\nlevel text.\\nThe popularity of Beck\\'s broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an\\naudience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience\\nthat socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that\\npatriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured \"Comrade Updates,\" in which Beck\\ndescribed perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal\\nReserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign\\nRelations (born of a \"progressive idea\" to manipulate the media in order to \"let the masses know what should be done\");\\nand a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen\\'s old target Colonel House and Welch\\'s old target Woodrow\\nWilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen\\'s books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a\\ndiatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from \"Secrets of the Federal Reserve,\" by Eustace Mullins. The book,\\ncommissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful\\nbankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.\\nPart of Beck\\'s allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing\\nof fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as \"the Roman symbol of Fascism\"—and then a picture of an old\\nMercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. \"Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was\\nthe President,\" he said. \"We\\'ve been on the road to Fascism for a while.\" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn\\'t adopt the\\nancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor\\nAdolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation\\'s military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate\\nthe desire for peace.\\nBeck\\'s readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he\\nwas not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term \"lunatic fringe\" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,\\nand his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big\\nbusiness—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent\\nAmerican troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies\\nin order to restore competition among small companies. \"If America is not to have free enterprise,\" Wilson declared, \"then\\nshe can have no freedom of any sort whatever.\"\\nIn 2007, Beck, then the host of \"Glenn Beck,\" on CNN\\'s Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society\\nspokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,\\n\"and eventually all throughout the Americas.\" Beck told Antonio, \"When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I\\nthought they were a bunch of nuts.\" But now, he said, \"you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me.\" His\\nguest beamed. \"Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,\" Antonio said. \"We are just exposing the truth that\\'s been\\nout there for many, many years.\" Since then, the Birch Society\\'s Web site has run clips from Beck\\'s Fox broadcasts,\\nproudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on\\nCommunism in America as \"the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American\\nhistory.\"\\nBeck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen\\'s close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under\\nPresident Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for\\na speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.\\nSchlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that \"the Constitution will be endangered and hang,\\nas it were, by a single thread,\" and praised the John Birch Society as \"the most effective non-church organization in our\\nfight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism.\" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,\\nintoning, \"Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming.\" The Birch Society\\'s Web site subsequently praised Beck for\\n\"getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch\\nSociety has been doing it for over 50 years.\"\\nBeck is no more the sole representative of today\\'s multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-\\nsixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was \"not involved with the Tea Party.\" Why, then,\\nhave the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative\\nRepublicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron\\nAngle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a \"freedom conference\" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John\\nBirch Society and Skousen\\'s old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as\\n\"mainstream America\" and patriots who had \"heard the call.\") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested\\nthat the election of a black President sowed \"fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in\\nthe country.\" There are signs that this is so: Republicans\\' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an \"activist Justice\" during\\nElena Kagan\\'s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the\\nminuscule New Black Panther Party. But \"socialist\" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal\\nReserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party\\'s fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big\\ngovernment generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama\\'s skin.\\nThe current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half\\ncentury. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in\\nNovember, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those \"discordant voices of\\nextremism\" that \"equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with\\nCommunism.\" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as\\nparanoids and conspiracy-mongers.\\nThe leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor\\nof National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph\\nMcCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was\\nset by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical\\nconservatives their chance at national power. \"By 1961,\" his biographer John B. Judis writes, \"Buckley was beginning to\\nworry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even\\nFascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted.\" In the next two decades,\\nwith Buckley\\'s support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that\\nsucceeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.\\nAs confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be\\nexpected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their\\nfellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley\\'s colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch\\nSociety went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the\\nconservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of\\n\"distorting reality\" and failing to make \"the crucial moral and political distinction\" between Communists and liberals, the\\nmagazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.\\nBy 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and\\nhe consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged\\nGoldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing \"kooks\"\\nlurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some \"nice guys,\" and that it would be injudicious\\nto attack the group in public. The Birchers\\' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in\\n1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no\\nvice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\"\\nIn the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats\\nsucceeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan \"In Your Heart, You Know He\\'s\\nRight,\" the Democrats shot back, \"In Your Guts, You Know He\\'s Nuts.\") Buckley\\'s fears had been confirmed. But he was\\nundeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon\\namong a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan\\'s politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently\\nbeen elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-\\nwashy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.\\nNixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had\\nestablished himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official\\nat the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. \"It seems to me that we\\nought to have a real chance of winning this year,\" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National\\nConvention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge\\nof Nixon\\'s media operations.\\nBut Buckley\\'s candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of\\nthe editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.\\nnomination in 1960, didn\\'t sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom\\nWelch had called one of \"the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene.\" As President, in 1969,\\nNixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious\\nappeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place\\nlater that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country\\'s anxieties over Vietnam,\\nBuckley and the mainstream of what he called \"responsible conservatism\" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives\\nwere left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch\\nSociety.\\nNixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The\\nconservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon\\'s\\nsecond term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon\\'s campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats\\'\\ninternal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had \"an indifference\\ntoward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom.\" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read\\nthe Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican\\nParty and in national politics.\\nIn 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan\\'s primary challenge to Nixon\\'s successor, Gerald Ford.\\nAfter two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a\\nshrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,\\ndemonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of\\nOrange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists\\' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His\\npragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the\\nrelatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision\\ndismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican\\nmoderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-\\nwinger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush\\'s selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who\\nunderstood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.\\nAs President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen\\'s Freemen\\nInstitute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style\\ngovernment, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He\\nappointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush\\'s close associate, his first chief\\nof staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy\\nadviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and\\nBaker\\'s deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights\\nlegislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan\\nskillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail\\nGorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed\\nforward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips\\'s phrase, \"a useful idiot for Soviet\\npropaganda.\"\\nWhatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the\\nfederal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the\\nstandpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to\\nmatching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,\\nand it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of\\nextremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal\\ncalamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of\\nattacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to\\ncheck some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom\\nDeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even\\nthough polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first\\nto have a bit of Reagan\\'s conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for\\nhis moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial\\ncollapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a\\nconservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that \"urbane visionaries and\\nbuilders of institutions\" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures \"who make their money by stirring fears and\\nresentments.\" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, \"has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,\" and is\\nnow ruled by those he called \"the crazy-cons.\"\\nSome Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former\\nspeechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the\\nRepublicans\\' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the\\ncongressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush\\'s financial bailout, lost a\\nvicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the\\ncampaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had\\nbought them at birth. \"And then, of course,\" he recalls, \"it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the\\nBilderbergers and all that stuff.\" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox\\nNews the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine\\nO\\'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were \"nutty.\" Instantly, criticism came from\\nSarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself \"a\\nhuge Tea Party fan,\" endorsing O\\'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give\\nher its full backing.\\nSo far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as\\nBuckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.\\nstalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;\\nGrist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the\\nRepublicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.\\nFifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right\\'s \"counsels of fear and suspicion.\" Today, Obama\\'s White\\nHouse is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the\\nleft, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O\\'Donnell may prove\\ntoo eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of\\ngovernment. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as \"a\\nmassive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party.\" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush\\npolitical operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly\\nsupplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year\\'s candidates.) But, according to a\\nrecent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a\\nRepublican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the\\ncoming midterm elections.\\nIn 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne\\'s fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social\\nand political tumult of the day into perspective. \"Th\\' noise ye hear is not th\\' first gun iv a revolution,\" Dooley remarked. \"It\\'s\\non\\'y th\\' people iv th\\' United States batin\\' a carpet.\" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the\\nsame about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a\\ndegree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For\\ndefenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •\\nRead more http://www.newyorker.com/reportinq/2010/10/18/101018fa fact wilentz?printable=true#ixzz123hWc5bzThis is the distilled, pure and utterly conventional wisdom of much of the DC political chattering class at this moment. The\\nfirst two paragraphs are the most important, completely accurate in assessment, the rest twaddle:\\n1:1\\nMonday, Oct. 11,2010\\nWhy Obama Is Losing the Political War\\nBy Mark Halperin\\nBarack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above, by elite opinion about his competence. From below, by\\nmass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after\\nNovember\\'s elections.\\nWith the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists, most politically engaged elites have reached the same\\nconclusions: the White House is in over its head, isolated, insular, arrogant and clueless about how to get along with or\\npersuade members of Congress, the media, the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by Fox\\nNews pundits, executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets, reporters who cover the White House, Democratic\\nand Republican congressional leaders and governors, many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised big\\nmoney for Obama in 2008, and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama\\'s\\ntroubled first year, issue by issue.)\\nOn Friday, after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data — the last major jobs figures before the midterms —\\nObama said, \"Putting the American people back to work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding the economic security of the\\nmiddle class is the moral and national challenge of our time.\" But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challenge\\nand are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover, there is a growing perception that\\nObama\\'s decisions are causing harm — that businesses are being hurt by the Administration\\'s legislation and that\\neconomic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing,\\nimmigration and spending.\\nAnd that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama\\'s capacity to turn\\nthings around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him — Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, but\\nalso tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how some\\nAmericans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)\\nThe misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman,\\nthe Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at a\\nDayton career fair says starkly, \"There are no jobs.\" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, \"I\\'ve been\\nlooking for a job now for 13 months.\" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, the\\nbreadlines for the Obama years.\\nMost of Obama\\'s private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.\\nHe did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to\\nstave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposals\\nbased on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven\\'t put forth specifics of their own, nor offered\\ngenuine compromise, while the media have allowed the right\\'s activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without\\nfurnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama\\'s top 10 sound bites.)\\nBut Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the\\neconomy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from\\nthe problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a\\nclear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and the\\nTroubled Asset Relief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority to\\nspur growth.\\nThroughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh,\\nCongressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership — or was it something\\nabout an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the time\\nof a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his\\ntop advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered\\nthrough the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative\\ntelevision commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters care\\nabout, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat story\\nline). Feinting and gibing can\\'t obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)\\nThe President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue,\\nthe health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for a\\nbetter economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said\\nFriday, \"the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, \\'You\\'re hired,\" and that\\'s still not\\noccurring for too many Americans.\\nThe politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in\\nJanuary. Republicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger.\\nThe President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning the\\npage on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, Republicans are almost certainly going\\nto demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama\\nAdministration hasn\\'t much to offer either, except more of the same that isn\\'t working.\\n• Find this article at:\\n• http://www.time.com/time/golitics/article/0,8599,2024718,00.html\\nCopyright © 2010 Time Inc.

Why Jim Jones was the worst national\\nsecurity advisor in decades.\\nBY DAVID J. ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER 8, 2010\\nThe president\\'s inexperience did in Jones more than any of the general\\'s deficits. He didn\\'t know what he wanted. He\\nvacillated on key issues. He simply demonstrated the problems America repeatedly has when it hires men with no foreign-\\npolicy background to take on the most important international job in the world. Further, he did not really know enough\\nabout how the presidency works to nip in the bud the creation of the inner-circle bubble that effectively negated much of\\nthe work that the formal policy process did. Obama encouraged (or tolerated for long-enough that it looks like\\nencouragement) his campaign foreign-policy deputies to continue to report directly to him, and this led to some public and\\nprivate backdooring of Jones that undercut his authority dramatically. He did not empower Jones, and that combined with\\nJones\\'s own shortcomings led to the zero-chemistry, ineffective collaboration that has been openly criticized by senior\\nWhite House and foreign policy officials since the spring of Obama\\'s first year in office.\\nIn fact the situation got so bad that Jones was publicly undercut by true Obama confidante Denis McDonough more than\\nonce. It is something of a surprise he lasted this long. As one former national security advisor said to me while we were\\ndiscussing a well-known instance of McDonough publicly undercutting Jones, \"That would have only happened once on\\nmy watch. It would have been me or him.\"The Huffington Post\\nOctober 12, 2010\\noward Fineman\\nfinemanAhuffingtonpost.com I HuffPost Reporting\\nThe Power Of Clinton, The Invisibility Of\\nObama\\nFirst Posted: 10-12-10 02:37 PM I Updated: 10-12-10 02:37 PM\\nLOUISVILLE -- I see that Dr. Rand Paul has taken out after Bill Clinton, dredging up Monica Lewinsky. And I know why\\nPaul did so. The former president was here in Kentucky yesterday and in this state, as in many others, he is a far more\\npotent and popular foe than President Barack Obama.\\nOn my first day working for The Huffington Post, I came back to Kentucky, where I began my career many years ago at\\nthe Courier-Journal. The people who run the University of Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted me to do an on-stage\\ninterview with a certain best-selling author who is also my new boss: Arianna Huffington. It was a tricky mix of professional\\nincest and personal nostalgia, but the event worked out well and I also got a chance to play Kentucky reporter once again\\nout in the state.\\nI raced over to Lexington and here is the ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed:\\nLike Voldemort\\'s, Obama\\'s is a name no one dares utter -- and that includes Clinton speaking to Democrats.\\nAt a sunny, noontime rally on the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington yesterday, the former president made\\na stirring, well-argued case for Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway and for Democrats generally -- without once\\nmentioning Obama and rarely mentioning the presidency. It was as though we suddenly had only two branches of\\ngovernment.\\nTo be fair, almost no one else at the one-hour rally mentioned the sitting president. And Kentucky is staunch Republican\\nterritory. \"We\\'re farther ahead in the generic ballot here than ever,\" GOP Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told me\\nyesterday. \"President Obama was never popular here, even at his peak.\"\\nStill, the eerie invisibility of the president is a telling commentary on the Democrats\\' confused, divided and defensive\\npredicament as they brace for the verdict of the voters on Election Day, Nov. 2. There was something odd -- and, if you\\'re\\na Democrat, depressing -- about a former Democratic president avoiding any mention of his Democratic successor.\\nClinton sincerely wants to help out on the trail -- and certainly wants to avoid the accusation that he didn\\'t try to help. But\\nhis travels have turned into a personal victory lap that often makes him -- not the candidate he\\'s touting -- the center of\\nattention. That was true here in Kentucky. The rally\\'s mechanics were mostly handled by the Secret Service; more to the\\npoint, the final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn\\'t Conway. It was Clinton. The Conway people didn\\'t mind. They\\nwere glad to have him.\\nRail-thin but not frail, wearing a tweedy professorial sports coat and his signature rueful, knowing smile, Clinton was\\ntreated with a respect bordering on awe. His familiar mane of white hair, thinning now, was translucent in the sun, giving\\nhim an almost otherworldly look: the Sage from a Better Age.\\nClinton is beloved In Kentucky. He won the state twice. He speaks the local dialect, which contains Appalachian notes of\\nworking-class pride, suspicion of big shots and Baptist revivalism. But more than that -- and more than just in Kentucky --\\nClinton\\'s economic record (22.7 million jobs created, and he tends not to forget to mention the .7) looks spectacularly\\ngood in the context of what has followed.\\nThese days there is almost an Old Testament, milk-and-honey reverence for that economic record, at least as expressed\\nby former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford. An old-school podium pounder, Ford -- stooped but still strong voiced at 86 --\\ntalked of the former president in messianic terms. \"Bill Clinton found us the path to gold!\" he shouted. The crowd of 2,000,\\nmost of them students, didn\\'t laugh. They seemed to think he was right.\\nHow any of this helps Obama is far from clear; it isn\\'t even clear that it helps many Democrats -- since they\\'d be joining\\nthe same Washington party that the current president ostensibly heads.\\nBut Clinton is all too happy to show Obama how it\\'s done. As a campaigner and as president, Clinton\\'s gift was his ability\\nto untangle the knots of even the most complex policy issue and explain it in plain language to people suspicious of the\\npowerful -- but eager not to be screwed by them or to be seen as dupes. Republicans and their corporate allies were out\\nto shut down the few good things that government does for you, he said, in the name of balancing a budget that they\\nthemselves destroyed. \"I gave you budget surpluses!\" Clinton said, as if this had been an act of personal beneficence.\\nKnowing his audience, the former president focused on Pell Grants, and on a new program that allows graduates to pay\\nback their loans over longer periods and at lower rates.

AM\\nThe Crossroads Nation\\nBy DAVID BROOKS\\nBill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a \"new foundation.\" But\\nClinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what\\nedifice is going to go on top of that foundation.\\nThey are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite defined\\nAmerica\\'s coming economic identity.\\nIn thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economic\\nactivity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we\\'re living in an information age. Innovation and\\ncreativity are the engines of economic growth.\\nHoward Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little place\\nsomewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. She\\nmoves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to create\\nsomething amazing.\\nThen, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her\\ngroup. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined and\\nimproved.\\nThe main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talented\\npeople get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.\\nNow imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or\\nsome other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you\\nare thinking about, creating the things you want to create.\\nIf you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it\\'s engineering, maybe it\\'ll be Germany. But if you are passionate\\nabout many other spheres, I suspect you\\'ll want to be in America.\\nYou\\'ll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You\\'ll want to come because American universities lead\\nthe world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.\\nYou\\'ll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. Huge\\nventure capital funds already exist.\\nMoreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation of\\nimmigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.\\nYou also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests that\\nAmerica is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of\\nkinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents.\\nAmerican underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country you\\'re less likely to have to submit to authority.\\nFrom this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. The\\ncrucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can make\\nitself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.\\nIn 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in which\\nshe laid out the logic of this new situation: \"In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasingly\\ndense global web.\"\\nSlaughter\\'s essay was titled \"America\\'s Edge.\" That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise,\\nnearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.\\nIn fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right\\nkinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists;\\nimprove infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of\\npassage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas.\\nThe nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There\\'s no reason to be pessimistic about that.Love it.pvervee\\nTuesday, November 9, 2010 7:23 PM\\nWelcome back!\\nYour trip looked very prodcutive from here and thanks for embracing the women\\'s initiatives in AU and NZ.

And then there\\'s the issue of an omnibus\\n[spending bill] versus a continuing resolution. There are a lot of other\\npotential issues. We\\'re going to try to get the nutrition bill.\"\\nHe was referring to ongoing talks over a possible extension of expiring\\nprovisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (PL 107-16, PL 108-27), the\\ndebate over whether to move an omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2011 or\\nanother temporary spending measure, and a stalled child nutrition bill (HR\\n5504).\\nVan Hollen said that Pelosi, D-Calif., did not bring up the issue of the\\ntough caucus race for minority whip — the second-ranking Democrat in\\nthe next Congress — between Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and James E.\\nClyburn of South Carolina. Both men were on the telephone call, Van\\nHollen said, but the issue did not come up.\\nDemocratic aides said Pelosi has encouraged both men to reach a\\nsettlement to avert the potentially bloody intraparty fight. \"That wasn\\'t\\npart of the discussion,\" Van Hollen said.See below\\nAlso, Allawi appears to be in.Will call shortly.Dear Anne-Marie,\\nI was just reading your two wonderful memos on 5/ P accomplishments and the QDDR.\\nI also want to thank you for a wonderful year of work, creativity, collaboration and progress.

But\\nwhere has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal\\nbegin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of \"Republican Gomorrah\", enters the heady\\nworld of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence\\nthat fuel its sub-culture\\'s insurgent activism.\\n\"He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since\\nthe Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?\\nIn reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility\" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-\\nSemite and Jew\\nI am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack\\nObama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.\\nPerusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard\\nurgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. \"These people that\\nare purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what\\'s going on in this country\", a gun dealer told me outside\\na show in Reno. \"Good luck Obama\", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. \"We outnumber him 100 to 1.\" At this time,\\nthe Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media\\'s radar.\\nIn September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah\\n(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan\\nWalton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay\\nformer Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen\\ncollege Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a \"left-wing hack\" while a hysterical\\nyoung man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a \"racist\". Afterward,\\nuniversity police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he\\nshouted threats.\\nWho was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative\\nof a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of\\nRepublican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in\\nhomosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a\\ncurable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of\\nrun-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.\\nMy encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be\\nsymptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right\\'s days of\\nrage were only beginning.\\nThe constellation\\nThrough his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against\\npartisanship, declaring that there were \"no red states\" and no \"conservative America\". Apparently, he thought it was\\nmerely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and\\nwomen\\'s rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to\\nthink that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was\\nnot deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain \"divisive\" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures\\ntoward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but\\nseparated by \"partisans\". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.\\nMany of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his\\ninnocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could \"bridge the partisan divide\". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected\\nconservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies \"fifth columnists\" but now fervently supported Obama,\\nwrote that the new president was destined to become \"a liberal Reagan who can reunite America\". This optimism\\npervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.\\nAfter all, why couldn\\'t we all just get along?\\nIn his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: \"I serve\\nas a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.\" Once he was elected,\\nconservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama\\'s strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most\\nfearsome images they could conjure (see \"Barack Obama, the fallen messiah\", 23 December 2009).\\nObama\\'s multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected\\nObama\\'s legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the \"Birther\" movement that sought\\nto challenge his citizenship. The movement\\'s most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a\\ndentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling\\nin the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that\\nObama planned to create a \"civilian national security force\", Taitz told me she \"realised that Obama was another Stalin -\\nit\\'s a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler\\'s Germany.\"\\nAfter becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama\\'s family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,\\nTaitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California\\'s secretary of state Debra Bowen\\ndemanding an investigation into Obama\\'s eligibility to serve as president. Taitz\\'s plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an\\nOrange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly\\nprayed for Obama\\'s death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,\\nTaitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers\\nfrom Sean Hannity to CNN\\'s Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her \"greatest supporter\", was eventually fired as\\nan indirect result of his hosting of her).\\nIn March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential\\ncandidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice\\nin government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican\\nrespondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn\\'t born in the United States, while 30% \"weren\\'t\\nsure\". \"Obama should be in the Big House\", Taitz shrieked to me, \"not the White House!\"\\nWhen Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement\\nactivated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the \"Other\", making him\\nseem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a\\nhealthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama\\'s dream of\\nbipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss\\'s MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-\\nright activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on\\nWashington\\'s National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News\\'s\\ntop-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the \"9-12 Project\" to restore the sense of unity (and siege\\nmentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.\\nWhile covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America\\'s security than al-Qaida;\\ndemonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama\\'s face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;\\nothers carried signs questioning Obama\\'s status as a United States citizen. \"We can fight al-Qaida, we can\\'t kill Obama\",\\nsaid an aging demonstrator. Another told me, \"Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world\", pointing to placards he had\\nfashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives\\' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to\\nanother activist, Obama\\'s agenda was similar to Hitler\\'s: \"Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had\\nhis own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.\"\\nThe seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies\\nagainst Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as\\nthe French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot\\nassassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.\\nMembers of the Tea Party \"Patriots\" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to\\nHitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government\\nof the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped\\nObama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no\\ninterest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea\\nParty\\'s primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president\\nand his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always\\ntransparent.\\nThe Tea Party\\'s strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats\\nbut also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced\\nthis would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the\\n\"real America\". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting\\nthat 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying \"ABCNews.com reported an approximate\\nfigure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters.\" Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of \"Freedom works! Freedom\\nworks!\" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-\\ngroup, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson\\'s version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.\\nIndeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea\\nParty movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.\\nThe movement\\'s leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea\\nParty \"Patriots\" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey\\'s\\nlobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant\\nBristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey\\'s other \"real American\"\\nclients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People\\'s Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from\\nSaddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected\\na consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks\\npaid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.\\nThe rumour\\nIf Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after\\nObama\\'s inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin\\'s motives for quitting\\nbecame clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular\\ncontributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, \"Sarah Palin\\'s Alaska\".\\nPalin\\'s book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential\\ncampaign and a travelling carnival.\\nWhether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the\\nRepublican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos\\ndesperately seeking to expand the party\\'s base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain\\'s\\ncampaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin\\'s nomination in 2012 would be\\n\"catastrophic\" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one\\nof the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for\\nSchmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its\\nmost fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.\\nA special congressional election in New York\\'s heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test\\nof Palin\\'s power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown\\nfar-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate\\nRepublican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin\\'s ideological purge in upstate New York led to an\\nimprobable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies\\nclaimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She\\nwent on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky\\'s\\nGOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush\\'s vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand\\'s\\nregular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.\\nThe self-described \"hardcore pro-lifer\" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay\\nmarriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement\\'s ranks, recasting herself\\naccordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of \"economic freedom\". She claimed the Democratic \"cap-\\nand-trade\" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare\\nreform as a Trojan horse for \"socialism\" (though she admitted her family \"used to hustle over the border\" to take\\nadvantage of Canada\\'s single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted\\nout on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for \"death panels\" that would\\nrecommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin\\ntransformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.\\nThe source of Palin\\'s \"death panels\" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York\\'s lieutenant governor Betsy\\nMcCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed\\nin an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into\\nthe government\\'s programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine\\nAward, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic\\'s editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a\\nrumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as \"the lie of 2009\". McCaughey\\'s\\nlatest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the\\nmainstream.\\nIn June 2009, one of LaRouche\\'s top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health\\'s\\nchief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler\\'s\\nT-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. \"President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus\\nreviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there\", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin\\ncharged. Soon, LaRouche\\'s followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a\\nHitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a\\nLaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: \"Why do you continue to support a Nazi\\npolicy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?\"\\nTwo months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker\\nNewt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of\\nindignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death\\npanels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of \"the devaluing of human life, putting a price on\\neach individual.\" He thundered, \"The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!\"\\nThe death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican\\nParty. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the\\nfederal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-\\nsponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,\\nwhen the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the\\ngovernment to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.\\nThe enemy\\nThe slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.\\nThe new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney\\'s daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep\\nAmerica Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN\\'s Larry King about the Birther movement\\nthat was challenging Obama\\'s status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: \"One of the reasons you see people\\nso concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so\\nreluctant to defend the nation overseas.\" With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same\\ntable, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.\\nThe experiments in \"terror-management theory\" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of\\nSkidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have\\ndemonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain\\nthe effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American\\nand somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical\\nreasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters\\nresponded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing\\narmy ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.\\nObama\\'s first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed\\nby far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat\\nteam of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski\\'s best friend told reporters the young killer \"grew angry recently over\\nfears Obama would outlaw guns.\" Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website\\nportraying Fox\\'s Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough\\ninvestigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party\\nrallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation\\nRescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by\\nthe anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas\\'s only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight\\nepisodes of Bill O\\'Reilly\\'s \"O\\'Reilly Factor,\" O\\'Reilly had referred to Tiller as \"Tiller the baby killer\", a criminal guilty of\\n\"Nazi stuff.\" \"I wouldn\\'t want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day\", O\\'Reilly proclaimed.\\nIn August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and\\ngunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini\\'s motives away by homing in on passages in his\\nonline diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic\\nmasturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual\\nfrustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.\\nThe day after Obama\\'s election victory, Sodini wrote: \"Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media\\nLOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama\\'s plans for the\\neconomy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude\\nthing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. \\'Not my little girl\\', daddy\\nsays! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].\"\\nIn another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans\\' Whitewater investigation, Sodini\\nrevealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, \"Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,\" from a National Review ad.\\nA year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: \"I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring\\nthe country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don\\'t think any group of political leaders will\\nachieve this for us.\" Whether or not Sodini\\'s murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically\\ndeath-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: \"Death\\nlives!\"\\nThe bible\\nMore than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and\\nconspiracy that consumed the Tea Party \"Patriots\". During a broadcast of \"Fox and Friends\", Beck opined that Obama\\n\"has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white\\nculture.\" As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community\\norganiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck\\'s crusade. From there, Beck targeted another\\nblack Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of\\nObama\\'s \"socialist\" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to\\n\"Obama money\" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-\\nbased youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to\\nBeck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that \"Obama\\'s SS\" was being\\ntrained across inner-city America.\\nIn September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to\\nuse the poor people\\'s advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. \"Trust me\", Beck said,\\n\"Everybody now says they\\'re going to be talking about healthcare. I don\\'t think so.\" (His statement was reminiscent of\\nRush Limbaugh\\'s scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: \"Whitewater is about healthcare.\")\\nBeck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O\\'Keefe and Hannah\\nGiles inside Acorn field offices.\\nIn the videos, O\\'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she\\nwas a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O\\'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp\\ncostume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later\\nadmitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of\\nall criminal wrongdoing.\\nIn a separate incident O\\'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals\\ndisguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary\\nLandrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O\\'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded\\nconservative outfits; O\\'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured\\nleading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.\\nWhile O\\'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned\\nthe highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O\\'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck\\'s\\nopinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. \"Glenn Beck has taught us everything we\\nknow\", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. \"He\\'s opened our eyes to so much.\"\\nBut unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich\\'s Republican counter-revolution of 1994,\\nBeck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,\\nBeck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in\\nhopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine\\nand alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. \"We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the\\ndrugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was\", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who\\ncalled himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.\\nLike Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan\\'s 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-\\ndestructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away\\nin a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from\\nfreedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into\\nconservative radio diatribes.\\n,When Beck first broke into television on CNN\\'s Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political\\nworldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and\\noften snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,\\nMatthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting\\nthe work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.\\nSuddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.\\nThanks to Beck\\'s designation of Skousen\\'s pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as \"required reading\" on the\\nwebsite of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the\\nHidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen\\'s Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon\\nand a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to\\nselling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is\\nlittle more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,\\nto explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation\\nis un-American, that \"coercive taxation\" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin\\nFranklin, who wrote at length on the merits of \"amours\" with \"old women,\" and who famously solicited prostitutes and\\nfathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.\\nThough Skousen claims the Founders as the world\\'s foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with\\nfringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd\\'s screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that\\n\"powerful influences congregating in the United States\" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United\\nStates into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd\\'s manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen\\'s Digest, which he\\nfounded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.\\nSkousen\\'s paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He\\nboasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist\\nplots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen\\'s son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours\\nof Hoover\\'s cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)\\nSkousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City\\'s police chief for, in the words of the city\\'s conservative Mormon mayor,\\n\"conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.\"\\nFrom there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and\\nearning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of \"promoting [his] own anti-\\ncommunism for obvious financial purposes.\"\\nSkousen\\'s vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society\\'s claim that communists controlled President Dwight\\nEisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the\\nradar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling\\neveryone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints\\ndistanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared\\nentirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik\\nobserved in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen\\'s renewed influence through Beck and the Tea\\nParty \"suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.\"\\nThe descent\\nBesides influencing Beck, Skousen\\'s teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement\\'s most visible grassroots\\ncelebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.\\nOn a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his\\nmentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his\\nspellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. \"If you control the food supply\", Mack warned, \"you control the\\npeople. And that\\'s the first step to slavery.\"\\nAlready a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun\\nViolence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack\\nreemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.\\nAlong with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea\\nParty militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to\\nrefuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.\\nBecause the group\\'s members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.\\nBesides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established\\nfigure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and\\nTactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on \"war criminals, secret policemen, rats.\" With Obama in office,\\nVandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by\\ncashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.\\nFor all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama\\'s agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the\\ngreatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since\\n1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform\\nwas introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the\\nde facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure\\nthat the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.\\nBut after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He\\nintroduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance\\nplans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in\\nhealthcare negotiations. \"He\\'s a big hero now in the pro-life community\", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to\\nGeorge W Bush - told me in November 2009. \"Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats\\nhaving any power.\"\\nTo the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to\\nHudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision\\nforbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,\\nObama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he\\nand his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports\\nseeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out\\nvirulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of\\ndiatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: \"Bart the Baby-Killer.\"\\nOn 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol\\'s Longworth Building in expectation of\\nObama\\'s pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the\\ncivil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the\\ncrowd on their way inside the Capitol. \"Nigger!\" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a \"faggot\", eliciting\\nlaughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel\\nCleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.\\nWith the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of \"Kill the bill!\" drifted into calls for violence. \"I would gladly stand\\nwith any of you men here and take these fascists down\", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of\\nan amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. \"You haven\\'t heard the last of me!\"\\nThe next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The\\ndemonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House\\nfloor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.\\nRepublican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak\\'s original amendment, demanded\\na motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In\\nresponse, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. \"The motion to commit does\\nnot support life\", Stupak declared. \"It is the Democrats who have stood up....\" Heckling from the Republican side\\ninterrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing\\nRepublican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, \"Baby\\nkiller!\" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults.\\nWhile the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a\\nright-wing Kristallnacht. \"If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows\",\\nVanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. \"Break them NOW. Break them and\\nrun to break again.\" Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and\\nArizona had been shattered.\\nMeanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed\\nto the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative\\nAnthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.\\nThe brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged\\nafter a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman\\'s) and encouraged\\nactivists to \"drop by\" to express their anger about Perriello\\'s recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic\\nRepresentative Gabrielle Giffords\\' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the\\nwindow of Representative Louise Slaughter\\'s office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper\\nattacks.\\nAfter the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.\\nCrusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows\\nof elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence\\nthickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: \"Don\\'t Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!\" Thus concluded the\\nfirst phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.I am currently out of the office traveling overseas with limited access to email.

Such a mood now seems to be\\nspreading through the United States. It\\'s\\nnot so surprising, really: Since the attacks\\nof September 11, 2001, fear has\\nbeen iniiecttcl into this \"homeland\" like a\\ndrug and a penumbia of official secrecy has\\nsettled over the land in a way that makes\\nthe secrecy of the Cold War years (when\\nthis country faced a superpower, not a\\nragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and\\nterrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.\\nIn an atmosphere of swirling fears and\\nhysteria amid declining living conditions,\\n\"explanations\" that at other times might\\nhave remained confined to tiny crews of\\nconspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a\\npatina of plausibility and so traction.

It\\nwas then that embittered\\nconservative forces, voted\\nout of power in 2008, sought\\nwith remarkable success to\\nleverage cultural resentment\\ninto political and partisan\\ngain.\\nThis network is obsessively\\nfixated on the supposed\\nspread of Muslim influence\\nin America.

It\\nbrings together in common\\ncause right-wing ultra-\\nZionists, Christian\\nevangelicals, and racist\\nBritish soccer hooligans.

One\\nphilanthropist in particular\\nhas provided the\\nbeneficence to propel the\\ncampaign ahead. He is a\\nlittle-known Los Angeles-\\narea software security\\nentrepreneur named Aubrey\\nChernick, who operates out\\nof a security consulting firm\\nblandly named the National\\nCenter for Crisis and\\nContinuity Coordination. A\\nformer trustee of the\\nWashington Institute for\\nNear East Policy, which has\\nserved as a think tank for the\\nAmerican Israeli Public\\nAffairs Committee\\n(AIPAC), a frontline\\nlobbying group for Israel,\\nChernick is said to be worth\\n$750 million.\\nChemick\\'s fortune is puny\\ncompared to that of the\\nbillionaire Koch Brothers,\\nextraction industry titans\\nwho fund Tea Party-related\\ngroups like Americans for\\nProsperity, and it is dwarfed\\nby the financial empire of\\nHaim Saban, the Israeli-\\nAmerican media baron who\\nis one of the largest.-orivate\\ndonors to the Democratic\\nparty and recently matched\\n$9 million raised for the\\nFriends of the Israeli\\nDefense Forces in a single\\nnight.

In\\n2003, three years after the\\ncollapse of President Bill\\nClinton\\'s attempt to resolve\\nthe Israeli-Palestinian issue\\nand in the immediate wake\\nof the invasion of Iraq, a\\nnetwork of Jewish groups,\\nranging from ADL and the.\\nAmerican Jewish\\nCommittee to AIPAC,\\ngathered to address what\\nthey saw as a sudden rise in\\npro-Palestinian activism on\\ncollege campuses\\nnationwide.

The film\\nportrayed that New York\\nCity school\\'s Department of\\nMiddle East and Asian\\nLanguages and Cultures as a\\nhothouse of anti-Semitism.\\nIn their complaints, the\\nstudents focused on one\\nfigure in particular: Joseph\\n.vlassa.d, a Palestinian\\nprofessor of Middle East\\nstudies. He was known for\\nhis passionate advocacy of\\nthe formation of a binational\\nstate between Israel and\\nPalestine, as well as for his\\nstrident criticism of what he\\ntermed \"the racist character\\nof Israel.\" The film\\nidentified him as \"one of the\\nmost dangerous intellectuals\\non campus,\" while he was\\nfeatured as a crucial villain\\nin The Professors: The 101\\nMost Dangerous Academics\\nin America, a book by the\\n(Chemick-•funded)\\nneoconservative activist\\nDavid Horowitz.

In 2009,\\nMassad earned tenure after\\nwinning Columbia\\'s\\nprestigious Lionel Trilling\\nAward for excellence in\\nscholarship.\\nHaving demonstrated its\\nability to intimidate faculty\\nmembers and even powerful\\nuniversity administrators,\\nhowever, Kramer claimed a\\nmoral victory in the name of\\nhis project, boasting to the\\npress that \"this is a turning\\npoint.\" While the David\\nProject subsequently\\nfostered chapters on\\ncampuses nationwide, its\\ndirector set out on a\\ndifferent path -- initially,\\ninto the streets of Boston in\\n2004 to oppose the\\nconstruction of the Islamic\\nSociety of Boston Cultural\\nCenter.\\nFor nearly 15 years, the\\nIslamic Society of Boston\\nhad sought to build the\\ncenter in the heart of\\nRoxbury, the city\\'s largest\\nblack neighborhood, to\\nserve its sizable Muslim\\npopulation. With\\nendorsements from Mayor\\nThomas Menino and leading\\nMassachusetts lawmakers,\\nthe mosque\\'s construction\\nseemed like a fait accompli -\\n- until, that is, the Rupert\\nMurdoch-owned Boston\\nHerald and his local Fox\\nNews affiliate snapped into\\naction. Boston Globe\\ncolumnist Jeff Jacoby also\\nchimed in with a series of\\nreports claiming the center\\'s\\nplans were evidence of a\\nSaudi Arabian plot to bolster\\nthe influence of radical\\nIslam in the United States,\\nand possibly even to train\\nunderground terror cells.\\nIt was at this point that the\\nDavid Project entered the\\nfray, convening elements of\\nthe local pro-Israel\\ncommunity in the Boston\\narea to seek strategies to\\ntorpedo the project.\\nAccording to emqiis\\nobtained by the Islamic\\nSociety\\'s lawyers in a\\nlawsuit against the David\\nProject, the organizers\\nsettled on a campaign of\\nyears of nuisance lawsuits,\\nalong with accusations that\\nthe center had received\\nforeign finding from \"the\\nWahhabi movement in\\nSaudi Arabia or... the\\nMoslem Brotherhood.\"\\nIn response, a grassroots\\ncoalition of liberal Jews\\ninitiat4d inter-faith efforts\\naimed at ending a\\ncontroversy that had\\nessentially been\\nmanufactured out of thin air\\nand was corroding relations\\nbetween the Jewish and\\nMuslim communities in the\\ncity.

The true aim\\nof the coalition, however,\\nwas transparent: to pressure\\nthe city\\'s leadership to adopt\\nan antagonistic posture\\ntowards the local Muslim\\ncommunity.\\nThe activists zeroed in on\\nthe school\\'s principal,\\nDebbie Almontaser, a\\nveteran educator of Yemeni\\ndescent, and baselessly\\n.branded her \"a jihadist\" as\\nwell as a 9/11 denier.

That is\\ndisturbing.\"\\nBefore any Qassam rockets\\ncould be launched from\\nAlmontaser\\'s school, her\\nformer ally New York\\nMayor Michael Bloomberg\\ncaved to the growing\\npressure and threatened to\\nshut down the school,\\nprompting her to resign.

In 2010, the Equal\\nEmployment Opportunity\\nCommission ui that New\\nYork\\'s Department of\\nEducation had \"succumbed\\nto the very bias that the\\ncreation of the school was\\nintended to dispel\" by firing\\nAlmontaser and urged it pay\\nher $300,000 in damages.\\nThe commission also\\nconcluded that the Post had\\nquoted her misleadingly.\\nThough it failed to stop the\\nestablishment of the Khalil\\nGibran Academy,•the\\nburg:eoning anti-M sliin\\nmovement succeeded in\\nforcing city leaders to bend\\nto its will, and having\\nlearned just how to do that,\\nthen moved on in search of\\nmore high-profile targets.\\nAs the ,New York Times\\ns!..t_..at the time, \"The\\nfight against the school...\\nwas only an early skirmish\\nin a broader, national\\nstruggle.\"\\ns a battle that has really\\njust begun.\" Pipes told the\\nTimes.\\nFrom Scam to Publicity\\nCoup\\nPipes couldn\\'t have been\\nmore on the mark. In late\\n2009, the Isiamophobes\\nsprang into action again\\nwhen the Cordoba Initiative,\\na non-profit Muslim group\\nheaded by Feisai Abdul\\nRauf, an exceedingly\\nmoderate Sufi Muslim imam\\nwho regularly\\nlepic,,etiting the\\nUnited States at the behest\\nof the State Department,\\nannounced that it was going\\nto build a community center\\nin downtown New \"NCork\\nCity. With the help of\\ninvestors, Raufs Cordoba\\nInitiative purchased space\\ntwo blocks from Ground\\nZero in Manhattan. The\\nspace was to contain a\\nprayer area as part of a large\\ncommunity center that\\nwould be open to everyone\\nin the neighborhood.\\nNone of these facts mattered\\nto Pamela Geller. Thanks to\\nconstant prodding at her\\nNog, Atlas Shrugged. Geller\\nmade Cordoba\\'s\\nconstruction plans a national\\nissue, provokino fervent\\ncalls faml conservatives to\\nprotect the \"hallowed\\nground\" of 9/11 from\\ncreeping Sharia. (That the\\n\"mosque\" would have been\\nout of sight of Ground Zero\\nand that the neighborhood\\nwas, in fact.\\neverything from strip clubs\\nto fast-food joints didn\\'t\\nmatter.) Geller\\'s activism\\nagainst Cordoba House\\nearned the 52-year-old full-\\ntime blogger the attention\\nshe apparently craved.,\\nincluding a • 1 in\\nthe Neu, York ThIleS and\\nfrequent cable news spots,\\nesoeciallv, of course, on Fox\\nNews.\\nMainstream reporters tended\\nto focus on Geller\\'s bizarre\\nstunts. She posted a video\\nof herself\\nin a string bikini on a Fort\\nLauderdale beach, for\\ninstance, while ranting about\\n\"left-tards\" and \"Nazi\\nHezbollah.\" Her gall for\\nboycotting Campbell\\'s Soup\\nbecause the company\\noffered halal -- approved\\nunder Islamic law (as kosher\\nfood is under Jewish law) --\\nversions of its products got\\nher much attention, as did\\nher .cron-lotior of a screed\\nclaiming that President\\nBarack Obama was the\\nillegitimate lovechild of\\nMalcolm X.\\nGeller had never earned a\\nliving as a journalist. She\\nsupported herself with\\nmillions of dollars in a\\ndivorce settlement and life\\ninsurance money from her\\nex-husband. He died in\\n2008, a year after being\\nfor an alleged $1.3\\nmillion scam he was\\naccused of-running out of a\\ncar dealership he co-owned\\nwith Geller. Independently\\nwealthy and with time on\\nher hands, Geller proved\\nable indeed when it came to\\nexploiting her strange media\\nstardom to in.cite the already\\norganized political network\\nof islamophobes to intensify\\ntheir crusade.\\nShe also benefited from\\nclose alliances with leading\\nislamophobes from Europe.\\nAmong Ocher\\'s allies was\\nAndrew Gravers, a Danish\\nactivist who formed the\\ngroup Stop the\\nIslamicization of Europe,\\nand :.1a.-ye it the unusually\\nblunt motto: \"Racism is the\\nlowest form of human\\nstupidity, but Islamophobia\\nis the height of common\\nsense.\" Gravers\\' group\\ninspired Geller\\'s own U.S.-\\nbased outfit, Stop the\\nIslamicization of America,\\nwhich she formed with her\\nfriend Robert Spencer, a\\npseudo-scholar whose\\nbestselling books, including\\nThe Truth About\\nMuhammad, Founder of the\\nWorld\\'s Most Intolerant\\nReligion, prompted former\\nadvisor to President Richard\\nNixon and Muslim activist\\nRobert Crane to ca/1\\n\"the principal leader... in\\nthe new academic .field of\\nMuslim bashing.\"\\n(According to the website\\nalmost $1 million\\nin donations from Chernick\\nhas been steered to\\nSpencer\\'s Jihad Watch\\ngroup through David\\nHorowitz\\'s Freedom\\nCenter.)\\nPerfect sources for\\nRepublican political figures\\nin search of the next hot-\\nbutton cause, their rhetoric\\nfound its way into the\\ntalking points of Newt\\nGingrich and Sarah Patin as\\nthey propelled the crusade\\nagainst Cordoba House into\\nthe national spotlight.\\nGingrich soon pared the\\ncommunity center to a Nazi\\nsign next to the Holocaust\\nMemorial Museum, while\\nPatin called it \"a stab in the\\nheart\" of \"the Heartland.\"\\nMeanwhile, Tea Party\\ncandidates like Republican\\nIlario Pantano, an Iraq war\\nveteran who killed two\\nunarmed Iraqi civilians,\\nshooting them 60 times -- he\\neven stopped to reload\\nmade their opppsition to\\nCordoba House the\\ncenterpiece of midterm\\ncongressional campaigns\\nconducted hundreds of miles\\nfrom Ground Zero.\\nGeller\\'s campaign against\\n\"the mosque at Ground\\nZero\" gained an unexpected\\nassist and a veneer of\\nlegitimacy from established\\nJewish leaders like Anti-\\nDefamation League\\nNational Director Abraham\\nFoxman. \"Survivors of the\\nHolocaust are entitled to\\nfeelings that are irrational,\"\\nhe et.:narked to the New\\nYork Times. Comparing the\\nbereaved family members of\\n9-1 1 victims to Holocaust\\nsurvivors, Foxman insisted,\\n\"Their anguish entitles them\\nto positions that others\\nwould categorize as\\nirrational or bigoted.\"\\nSoon enough, David Harris,\\ndirector of the (Chernick-\\nfunded) American Jewish\\nCommittee, was demanding\\nthat Cordoba\\'s leaders be\\ncompelled to reveal their\\n\"true attitudes\" about\\nPalestinian militant groups\\nbefore construction on the\\ncenter was initiated. Rabbi\\nMarvin Hier of the Simon\\nWiesenthal Center of Los\\nAngeles, another major\\nJewish group, insisted it\\nwould be \"insensitive\" for\\nCordoba to build near \"a\\ncemetery,\" though his\\norganization had recently\\nbeen granted permission\\nfrom the municipality of\\nJerusalem to build a\\n\"museum of tolerance\" to be\\ncalled The Center for\\nHuman Dignity directly on\\ntop of the Mamilla\\nCemetery, a Muslim\\nGraveyard that contained\\nthousands of grave sites\\ndating back 1,200 years.\\nInspiration from Israel\\nIt was evident from the\\ninvolvement of figures like\\nGravers that the\\nIslamophobic network in the\\nUnited States represented a\\ntrans-Atlantic expansion of\\nsimmering resentment in\\nEurope. There, the far-right\\nwas storming to victories in\\nparliamentary elections\\nacross the continent in part\\nby appealing to the\\nsimmering anti-Muslim\\nsentiments of voters in rural\\nand working-class\\ncommunities. The extent of\\nthe collaboration between\\nEuropean and American\\nIslamophobes has only\\ncontinued to grow with\\nGeller, Spencer, and even\\nGingrich standing beside\\nEurope\\'s most prominent\\nanti-Muslim figure, Dutch\\npad iamentarian Geed\\nWilders, at a rally against\\nCordoba House. In the\\nmeantime. Geller was\\nissuing statements of\\nsunport for the Emdish\\nDefense League, a band of\\nuoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis\\nand former members of the\\nwhites-only British National\\nParty who intimidate\\nMuslims in the streets of\\ncities like Birmingham and\\nLondon.\\nIn addition, the trans-\\nAtlantic Islamophobic\\ncrusade has stretched into\\nIsrael, a country that has\\ncome to symbolize the\\nnetwork\\'s fight against the\\nMuslim menace. As Geller\\ntold the New York Times\\'\\nAlan Feuer, Israel is \"a very\\ngood guide because, like I\\nsaid, in the war between the\\ncivilized man and the\\nsavage, you side with the\\ncivilized man.\"\\nEDL members regularly\\nwave Israeli flags at their\\nrallies, while Wilders claims\\nto have formed his views\\nabout Muslims during the\\ntime he worked on an Israeli\\ncooperative farm in the\\n1980s. He has, he says,\\nvisited the country more\\nthan 40 times since to meet\\nwith rightist political allies\\nlike Aryeh Eldad, a member\\nof the Israeli Knesset and\\nleader of the far right\\nHatikvah faction of the\\nNational Union Party. He\\nhas called for forcibly\\n\"transferring\" the\\nPalestinians living in Israel\\nand the occupied West Bank\\nto Jordan and Egypt. On\\nDecember 5th, for example,\\nWilders traveled to Israel for\\na \\'ffrjend nieei,imr, with\\nForeign Minister Avi2clor\\nLieberman, then declared at\\na press conference that\\nIsrael should annex the West\\nBank and set up a\\nPalestinian state in Jordan.\\nIn the apocalyptic clash of\\ncivilizations the global anti-\\nMuslim network has sought\\nto incite, tiny armed Jewish\\nsettlements like Yitzar,\\nlocated on the hills above\\nthe occupied Palestinian city\\nof Nablus, represent front-\\nline fortresses. Inside\\nYitzar\\'s state-funded\\nyeshiva, a rabbi named\\nYitzhak Shapira has\\ninstructed students in what\\nrules must be applied when\\nconsidering killing non-\\nJews. Shapira summarized\\nhis opinions in a widely\\npublicized book. Torat\\nHaMelech, or The King\\'s\\nTorah. Claiming that non-\\nJews are \"uncompassionate\\nby nature,\" Shapira cited\\nrabbinical texts to declare\\nthat gentiles could be killed\\nin order to \"curb their evil\\ninclinations.\" \"There is\\njustification,\" the rabbi\\nproclaimed, \"for killing\\nbabies if it is clear that they\\nwill grow up to harm us, and,\\nin such a situation they\\' may\\nbe harmed deliberately, and\\nnot only during combat with\\nadults.\"\\nIn 2006, the rabbi was\\nbriefly held by Israeli police\\nfor urging his supporters to\\nmurder all Palestinians over\\nthe age of 13. Two years\\nlater, according to the Israeli\\nnewspaper Ilaaretz, he\\na rabbinical letter in\\nsupport of Israeli Jews who\\nhad brutally assaulted two\\nArab youths on the country\\'s\\nHolocaust Remembrance\\nDay. That same year,\\nShapira was arrested as a\\nsuspect in helping\\na rocket attack\\nagainst a Palestinian village\\nnear Nablus.\\nThough he was not charged,\\nhis name came up again in\\nconnection with another act\\nof terror when, in January\\n2010, the Israeli police\\nraided his settlement\\nseeking vandals who had set\\nfire to a nearby mosque.\\nOne of Shapira\\'s followers,\\nan American immigrant,\\nJack _Mite\", has confessed to\\nmurdering two innocent\\nPalestinians and attempting\\nto the kill the liberal Israeli\\nhistorian Ze\\'ev Sternhell\\nwith a mail bomb.\\nWhat does all this have to\\ndo with Islamophobic\\ncampaigns in the United\\nStates? A great deal,\\nactually. Through New\\nYork-based tax-exempt non-\\nprofits like the Central Fund\\nof Israel and Ateret\\nCohenim, for instance, the\\nomnipresent Aubrey\\nChernick has sent tens of\\nthousands of dollars to\\nsupport the Yitzar\\nsettlement, as well as to the\\nmessianic settlers dedicated\\nto \"Judaizing\" East\\nJerusalem. The settlement\\nmovement\\'s leading online\\nnews magazine. Arutz\\nSheva, has feattired Geller\\nas a columnist. A friend of\\nGeller\\'s, Beth Gili.nsky, a\\nright-wing activist with a\\ngroup called the Coalition to\\nHonor Ground Zero and the\\nfounder of the Jewish\\nAction Alliance (apparently\\nttun. out of a Manhattan real\\nestate office), organized a\\nlarge rally in New York City\\nin April 2010 to protest the\\nObama administration\\'s call\\nfor a settlement freeze.\\nAmong Chemick\\'s major\\nfunding recipients is a\\nsupposedly \"apolitical\"\\ngroup called Aish.

Based\\nin New York and active in\\nthe fever swamps of\\nnorthern West Bank\\nsettlements near Yitzar,\\nAish Hatorah shares an\\naddress and staff with a\\nshadowy foreign non-profit\\ncalled the Clarion Fund.\\nDuring the 2008 U.S.\\nelection campaign, the\\nClarion Fund distributed 28\\nmillion DVDs of a\\npropaganda film called\\nObsession as newspaper\\ninserts to residents of swing\\nstates around the country.\\nThe film featured a who\\'s\\nwho of anti-Muslim\\nactivists, including \\\\Valid\\nShoebat, a self-proclaimed\\n\"former PLO terrorist.\"\\nAmong Shoebat\\'s more\\nstriking statements: \"A\\nsecular dogma like Nazism\\nis less dangerous than is\\nIslamofascism today.\" At a\\nChristian gathering in 2007,\\nthis \"former Islamic\\nterrorist\" told the crowd that\\nIslam was a \"satanic cult\"\\nand that he had been born\\nagain as an evangelical\\nChristian. In 2008, however,\\nthe Jerusalem Post, a right-\\nleaning newspaper, exposed\\nh rn as a fraud, whose\\nclaims to terrorism were\\nfictional.\\nIslamophobic groups\\nregistered only a minimal\\nimpact during the 2008\\nelection campaign. Two\\nyears later, however, after\\nthe Republicans regained\\ncontrol of the House of\\nRepresentatives in midterm\\nelections, the network\\nappears to have reached.\\ncritical mass. Of course, the\\ndeciding factor in the\\nelection was the economy,\\nand in two years, Americans\\nwill likely vote their\\npocketbooks again. But that\\nthe construction of a single\\nIslamic community center or\\nthe imaginary threat of\\nSharia law were issues at all\\nreflected the influence of a\\nsmall band of locally\\noriented activists, and\\nsuggested that when a\\ncertain presidential\\ncandidate who has already\\nbeen demonized as a crypto-\\nMuslim runs for reelection,\\nthe country\\'s most vocal\\nIslamophobes could once\\nagain find a national\\nplatform amid the frenzied\\natmosphere of the campaign.\\nBy now, the Islamophobic\\ncrusade has gone beyond the\\nright-wing pro-Israel\\nactivists, cyber-bigots, and\\nambitious hucksters who\\nconceived it. It now belongs\\nto leading Republican\\npresidential candidates, top-\\nrated cable news hosts, and\\ncrowds of Tea Party\\nactivists. As the fervor\\nspreads, the crusaders are\\nbasking in the glory of what\\nthey accomplished. \"I didn\\'t\\nchoose this moment,\" Geller\\nmused to the New York\\nTimes, \"this moment chose\\nme.\"\\nA/lax Blumenthal is an\\naward-winning journalist\\nwhose work has appeared in\\nthe New York Times, the\\nLos Angeles Times, the\\nDaily Beast, the Nation, the\\n114ington Post, the\\nIndependent Film Channel,\\nSalon, corn, Al Jazeera\\nEnglish, and other\\npublications.

Mr. Richards has\\na 3 o\\'clock appointment. \"Come on in, he\\'ll be here in a minute,\" an assistant says — and here he comes in a minute, at\\n3:01. This from a man who once prided himself for operating on Keith Time, as in: the security staff ate the shepherd\\'s pie\\nthat Keith wanted in his dressing room? Then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait. The Rolling Stones\\ndon\\'t play until another shepherd\\'s pie shows up.\\nChalk up the promptness to the man\\'s new incarnation: he is now Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, he is far\\nfrom the only rock star to turn memoirist, and far from the only Rolling Stone to write a book about himself — very much\\nabout himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote \"Ronnie,\" in which he described Brian Jones as \"me in a blond wig.\" Bill\\nWyman, the band\\'s retired bass player and bean counter, wrote \"Stone Alone,\" in which not a 15-shilling demo disc went\\nunmentioned. Now Mr. Richards has written the keeper: \"Life,\" a big, fierce, game-changing account of the Stones\\' nearly\\nhalf-century-long adventure.\\n\"It\\'s the most difficult thing I\\'ve ever done,\" he says about the book. \"I\\'d rather make ro records.\"\\nBut he sounds anything but weary. And he seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered, kohl-\\neyed pirate Keith Richards who looks like 50 miles of bad road. Today, in neutral street clothes and hot-green shoes, he is\\npositively debonair. On his hands: the ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, the thin white scar from a hunk of\\nsteaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through a concert without stopping. On his head:\\nboth a headband and a raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking out in all directions. Not a single gewgaw hangs off it.\\n\"I\\'ve been through that phase,\" he says. \"Don\\'t know that the hair will take the pressure anymore.\"\\nHe\\'s been through quite a lot of phases. And they\\'re all on the page in \"Life\": the Boy Scout (really); the tyro rocker; the\\nlovestruck kid (mad for Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst to Phil Spector); the astonished new star; the heroin-addicted older\\none; the jaded veteran of countless world tours; and the longtime sparring partner of Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shock\\nover the bickering in the book, these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early 198os.) All of\\nthis is recounted with straight-up candor, and some of it is easily sensationalized. But the book\\'s single biggest stunner is a\\nhand-written note on its jacket flap: \"Believe it or not, I haven\\'t forgotten any of it.\"\\nHow, he is asked, is this humanly possible from a man as well known for stupefaction as \"Satisfaction?\" \"I think my main\\nconcern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable,\" he says. \"Fox had to do a little sleuthing.\" Fox is\\nJames Fox, the journalist and author of \"White Mischief,\" who has been Mr. Richards\\'s friend over many years and was\\nhis collaborator in putting \"Life\" together. (It was sold to Little, Brown & Company for a reported advance of more than $7\\nmillion.)\\nMr. Fox wound up researching Mr. Richards\\'s past, conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawing\\nupon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries. \"Spent day practising,\" the 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote in\\nJanuary 1963, when the Stones were just beginning to play in public. \"Worthwhile, I hope!\" Also exhumed: a 1962 letter\\nfrom Mr. Richards to his Aunt Patty describing a boy he had known in primary school, Mick Jagger. He signs off\\n\"Luff/Keith XXXXX\"\\nThese artifacts turned out to be the Richards equivalent of Proust\\'s madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading taste\\nruns to naval history and the novels of Patrick O\\'Brian and George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put it that way. In any\\ncase they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover, and \"Life\" began to click. Once his stories were told\\nand a draft was written, he and Mr. Fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as Mr. Fox read\\nB6\\nthe whole book aloud. \"What I couldn\\'t guess was that he\\'d be such a very good natural editor,\" Mr. Fox, reached by e-\\nmail, says of Mr. Richards. \"He cut, accordingly, for pace and rhythm — a real musical cut.\"\\nAs for calling the book \"Life,\" Mr. Richards did some editing there too. \"My Life\" was what the book was to be called. \"I\\nsaid \\'I tell you what, just cut off the \\'My,\\' and you\\'ve got a title,\" he says. He might just as appropriately have used another\\ntitle he likes, \"Keep It Dark.\" But, he says, \"I\\'m saving it for a song.\"\\nThe contents of \"Life\" are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was\\npersuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having a\\npicture taken with him. How did Mr. Richards get so lucky? \"I really can\\'t explain it,\" he says, deadpan, about that now.\\n\"Maybe I\\'ve got an honest face.\"\\nIt covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards\\'s grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims to\\nhave done successfully 30 years ago. \"Stories like this aren\\'t told very much,\" he insists. \"There aren\\'t many people willing\\nto tell them.\"\\nThen there are the other health hazards that the book describes. Like electrocution. \"My most spectacular one was in\\nSacramento. ...\" he now says with a smile, drifting off into a fond-sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching an\\nungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth. He has a good laugh at the memory of finding\\nhimself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say, \"Well, they either wake up or they don\\'t.\"\\n\"Life\" has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe at Mr. Jagger. But this is a book\\nthat pulls no punches, and most of its disses are more serious than that. \"Cold-blooded\" and \"vicious\" are only two of the\\nmore printable words he uses to describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg was an \"old gasbag.\" Mick Taylor, the former\\nRolling Stone, \"didn\\'t do anything\" after he left the band, and Donald Cammell, the film director (\"Performance,\" starring\\nMr. Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards\\'s longtime lover and partner in crime), couldn\\'t commit suicide quickly\\nenough to suit Mr. Richards. (He shot himself in 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms. Pallenberg, Mr.\\nRichards remembers replying with this: \"Later, pal.\"\\nAs for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity,\\nunethical business behavior and — here comes a Freudian\\'s holiday for anyone who\\'s ever watched the bare-chested young\\nJagger and Richards vamp it up together — uncertain sexual identity. There\\'s also a cool condescension about Mr. Jagger\\'s\\ncontributions to the duo\\'s songwriting. And a nasty nickname or two, like \"Disco Boy.\"\\nIn conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blase: \"It\\'s bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is I\\'m\\ntrying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,\" he says. And sure: \"There\\'s the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh it\\nall out, those things count for nothing.\" Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of\\ntime. \"The important thing to me,\" he says, \"was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.\"And\\nis there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? \"No.\"\\nBut is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As \"Life\" emphatically demonstrates, the answer is\\nyes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls \"Keefs Guitar\\nWorkshop.\" Here are the secrets of some of the world\\'s most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment on\\nwhich they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for\\n\"Street Fighting Man,\" \"Jumpin\\' Jack Flash\" and part of \"Gimme Shelter.\" Here\\'s how the silent beats in Elvis Presley\\'s\\n\"Heartbreak Hotel\" worked their way into some of Mr. Richards\\'s most inspired solos. Mr. Fox found that \"Heartbreak\\nHotel\" itself was the key to some of Mr. Richards\\'s best musical memories.\\nSome of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the layman\\'s level. And he is\\nsurprised to find that early readers haven\\'t been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them to\\ndo so. What he finds most gratifying about having written \"Life\" is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the\\nbreadth and range of this book\\'s material. He is the rare memoirist who can say, without hyperbole, \"that what I hoped\\nwas worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine.\"\\nIt\\'s getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richards\\'s name is emblazoned on a director\\'s chair;\\nwhere assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere; where there\\'s a discreet little skull in the middle of\\nthe wall mirror; where his Louis Vuitton guitar case — he did an ad for Vuitton — is parked in a corner. But the items\\nlikeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder, a lighter, more\\ncigarettes in a pack.\\n\"Do you mind if I smoke?\" he had asked when he first appeared. Easy one: Who, aside from Keith Richards and certain\\nlegal authorities, has ever kept Keith Richards from doing anything? But an hour has gone by, and he hasn\\'t touched the\\ncigarettes. He hasn\\'t even looked at them. He has done not one thing to make him resemble the sullen, haunted,\\ndiabolically beautiful creature on the cover of his book, the one with hellfire blazing up from his hand to meet the blurry\\nwhite thing he\\'s smoking.\\n\"That?\" he says innocently when asked about the picture. \"Oh, that\\'s just me lighting a cigarette. That\\'s all I was doing.\"aned by Woodward\\'s Fire\\nby Leslie H. Gelb\\nSeptember 23, 2010 I 1:32pm\\nThe president and his team cooperated with the famed author\\'s new book. Leslie H. Gelb on the\\nfallout—and how Obama\\'s Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.\\nLots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of History, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the\\nclosed doors of President Obama\\'s most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president\\'s men were\\nhelping The Washington Post\\'s sleuth write \"the inside story\" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of\\nHerculean labors—the war in Afghanistan. There\\'s only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:\\nOnce the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to \"tell their side of the\\nstory.\" By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,\\nno one looks terribly heroic.\\nLet\\'s start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama\\'s Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,\\nand confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents\\' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a\\nbrilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that\\nhe trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.\\nThe worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals\\ndid not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what\\nthe generals were giving him. He didn\\'t get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after\\nthey reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The\\nmilitary didn\\'t provide him with that, either.\\nAs they say in Missouri, \"Give me a break.\" If the commander in chief of the United States doesn\\'t know how to get what\\nhe wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the White\\nHouse who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn\\'t\\nunderstand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president\\'s\\nwishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the\\nstrategy all by himself.\\nThis was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear\\nenough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to\\npursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told\\nWoodward that he didn\\'t think about the Afghan war in the \"classic\" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. \"I think about it\\nmore in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at\\nthe end?\" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011\\ndeadline to begin withdrawal was firm: \"I have to say that. I can\\'t let this be a war without end, and I can\\'t lose the whole\\nDemocratic Party.\" Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn\\'t? Or to White House aides:\\n\"This needs to be a plan about how we\\'re going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan.\" So, if he wanted such a plan, he\\nshould have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.\\nWhich leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.\\nAnd they sure don\\'t like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don\\'t fathom\\nwell the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn\\'t like to go to war; they like to build up\\ntheir arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,\\nvictory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don\\'t like it. For their part,\\nDemocrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don\\'t care for the suits either. It\\'s not\\na happy circumstance. Woodward didn\\'t explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.\\nbreakAd\\nThe White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal\\'s firing over\\nnaughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—and\\nperhaps even his senior Army aides—were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys—you know, the\\nusual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.\\nThere\\'s another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than\\nright. That is, Woodward\\'s repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner\\nsanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My\\ninformation has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt\\nthat Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost\\nalways quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General\\nMcChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm\\nEmanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—in\\nadvance of presidential decisions. And that\\'s a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama\\'s top advisers did as\\nmuch. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified\\nU.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn\\'t have to take this date too seriously,\\nthat everything was \"conditions based.\" That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.\\nSo, if anything, most of Obama\\'s top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to be\\ngoing. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it\\'s a stunner: \"You have to recognize\\nalso that I don\\'t think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It\\'s a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has been\\nenormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay after\\nit. This is the kind of fight we\\'re in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids\\' lives.\" The brilliant general said as much\\nto others over the last year. It\\'s enough to knock your socks off.\\nSo far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on\\nforever.\\nDoubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He\\'s sworn to that time and again, and I believe\\nhim, despite his history of calling for \"victory\" and \"defeat\" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward book\\ndemonstrates is that Obama and his team just don\\'t know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes to\\nthis narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.\\nLeslie H.

I will send you memos on latest political intel and policy ideas for\\nEurope in next few days. Sid\\nUS Hikers Were Seized in Iraq\\nBy Babak Sarfaraz\\nPosted on June 24, 2010, Printed on October 22, 2010\\nhttp://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/\\nKURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN—\\nSince their arrest last July by Iranian forces near the Iraq\\nborder, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and\\nSarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakes\\ndiplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranian\\nauthorities have repeatedly accused the three of entering Iran\\nto conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of the\\nthree, along with the State Department, the Committee to\\nProtect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund\\n[Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared in\\nThe Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spying\\ncharge and suggested that the Americans accidentally crossed\\nthe border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well-\\npublicized visit by the detainees\\' mothers in May, Iran has\\nreleased little information about the circumstances of their\\narrest or the status of their case.\\nThe Nation and The Investigative Fund have located two\\nwitnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal and\\nShourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — not\\nin Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additional\\nsources report that the Revolutionary Guards officer who\\nlikely ordered their detention has since been arrested on\\ncharges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder.\\nThe witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq called\\nZalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; they\\ndeclined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian\\nforces, who have been known to conduct missions across the\\nborder. The witnesses separately reported noticing the three\\nAmericans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormal\\nregion, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain lies\\nin Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers and\\noccasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked,\\nalthough local residents are familiar with its boundaries.\\nThe witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out\\nof curiosity, say that around 2 pm on July 31, as the hikers\\ndescended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA,\\nIran\\'s national police force, waved the hikers toward the\\nIranian side using \"threatening\" and \"menacing\" gestures.\\nWhen their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into\\nthe air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked\\na few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction,\\nand apprehended them.\\nThese witness accounts corroborate a statement Bauer made\\non May 20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotel\\nbetween the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Times\\nreported, Bauer \"denied that they had walked into Iran, as\\nthey were accused of doing, before stopping himself and\\nsaying, \\'We can\\'t really talk about that.\"\\nFarhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimed\\nthat the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in a\\ncross-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the Daily\\nTelegraph in August 2009. Lohoni said that his relatives had\\nseen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told the\\nTelegraph that the hikers \"were targeted and captured by a\\ngroup that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraq\\'s sovereignty.\\nWe know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to take\\nAmericans hostage at this sensitive time.\"\\nA State Department spokesman said that he had been unaware\\nof evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory but\\nwould not comment further.\\nOnce captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car to\\nthe local headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in\\nMarivan, a town close to the border in the province of\\nKurdistan. When they arrived, according to two sources, the\\nAmericans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. Heyva\\nTaab, then head of the Revolutionary Guards\\' intelligence\\nunit in the region. According to these sources — a former\\nmember of the Revolutionary Guards and an official who\\nserves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taab\\nwould have had the authority to order the Americans\\'\\ndetention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of the\\nIranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, the\\nRevolutionary Guards are responsible for maintaining\\nnational security throughout the Islamic Republic.\\n\"When I heard the news that they had arrested American\\nhikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of the\\nintelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guards, because they\\nhave people in this region,\" says Idris Ahmedi, an Iranian\\nKurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholar\\nat Georgetown University. \"I thought they were most likely\\nlured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. It\\nis consistent with Iran\\'s past actions.\"\\nLess than a month later, in late August 2009, Taab himself\\nwas arrested and charged with the July 6 murder of the son of\\nMostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) of\\nMarivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi\\'s nephew\\nwas also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab has\\nbeen implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing a\\nprofitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapes\\nand kidnappings. According to the Sanandaj official,\\nnumerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed against\\nTaab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping and\\nmurder. Taab\\'s case has twice been before a judge, and he\\nawaits execution in a Tehran prison.\\nAlthough the state-run Iranian press has not reported on\\nTaab\\'s crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in\\nJanuary and February by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va\\nKurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A\\nFebruary 17 article describes Taab as the head of a \"criminal\\nband\" and reports that Taab and seven accomplices were\\nunder arrest by the Revolutionary Guards for their role in a\\nvast number of illegal killings.\\nSeveral sources describe Taab as the central power in\\nKurdistan province. According to locals and experts, control\\nof the border lies in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, in\\nparticular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local\\ndivision had been commanded by Taab for about five years.\\n\"At this point it\\'s really the Sepah, the Revolutionary Guards,\\nthat are in charge, especially in the western provinces,\\nespecially because the Americans are on the other side, in\\nIraq,\" says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor of\\ninternational studies at DePaul University and an Iran expert\\nwho serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle East\\nReport. \"On the surface the security force [NAJA] is in\\ncharge, but it really is the Revolutionary Guards that control\\nthe borders.\"\\nIt is a region where, according to several Iran experts,\\nsmuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iran\\nborder is \"relatively porous because it\\'s mountainous,\" says\\nFaraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch,\\nwhich issued a report last year on political freedom in Iranian\\nKurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escape\\nroute for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates\\nand Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade route\\nfor goods. \"Smuggling is something that has taken place and\\ncontinues to take place there, whether it be of goods or of\\nhumans across the border. It\\'s something that happens quite\\noften.\"\\nSoon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwestern\\nquadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off the\\nblack-market border economy. According to the Sanandaj\\nofficial and the former Revolutionary Guards officer, who\\nhad firsthand knowledge of Taab\\'s activities, Taab\\'s first\\nscheme involved selling merchandise confiscated from petty\\nsmugglers, known as koolbars, who traffic consumer goods\\nacross the border (a trade depicted in the Iranian film A Time\\nfor Drunken Horses, which won the Camera d\\'Or at Cannes\\nin 2000).\\nThe region is also home to a variety of Kurdish nationalist\\ngroups that have been demanding autonomy from the central\\nTehran government. One of these, the Party for Free Life in\\nKurdistan (PJAK), is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers\\'\\nParty, a Kurdish separatist organization that engages in armed\\nconflict within Turkey and has been labeled a terrorist\\norganization by the United States and other governments.\\nSince 2005 PJAK, based in the mountains in Kurdish Iraq,\\nhas been in open conflict with Tehran and has claimed\\nresponsibility for killing dozens of Revolutionary Guards\\nsoldiers in cross-border raids on Iranian military bases, as\\nwell as for the February 2007 downing of an Iranian military\\nhelicopter by a shoulder-launched missile in Khoy, in\\nWestern Azerbaijan province, which killed thirteen Iranian\\nsoldiers.\\nIt has been speculated that some of these Kurdish militants\\nenjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis\\nKucinich wrote a letter to President Bush questioning whether\\nthe US government was \"fomenting opposition and\\nsupporting military operations in Iran among insurgent groups\\nand Iranian ethnic minority groups, some of whom are\\noperating from Iraq.\" Kucinich named two groups, including\\nPJAK. In November of that year, Seymour Hersh reported in\\nThe New Yorker that \"Israel and the United States have also\\nbeen working together in support of a Kurdish resistance\\ngroup known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan,\" and that\\na government consultant told him that the Israeli government\\nhad provided \"equipment and training\" to PJAK.\\nThe United States and Israel have denied any involvement\\nwith PJAK. Still, these allegations of support have gained\\nsubstantial traction inside Iran and may have undergirded\\nTaab\\'s decision to detain Bauer, Fattal and Shourd as well as\\nthe repeated public charges of espionage against the three. In\\nearly April, for instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar\\nMoslehi told Iran\\'s Press TV that \"it is quite obvious to us\\nthat the three Americans arrested in Iran last year had links\\nwith Western and Israeli intelligence services.\"\\nThe Iranian government has retaliated against rising Kurdish\\nmilitancy by launching a counteroffensive on PJAK, inside\\nIran and across the border in Iraq. In August 2007, for\\nexample, Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraq and attacked\\nseveral villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, on June\\n4, officials in Iraq\\'s semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged\\nthat \"a small unit of Iranian soldiers,\" including a tank and\\nseveral other vehicles, had penetrated more than a mile into\\nIraqi Kurdistan\\'s Arbil province in search of Kurdish rebels.\\nUntil his arrest, Taab was a key player in Iran\\'s counter-\\noffensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says that\\nseveral current members of the Guards told him that Taab\\'s\\nstated goal was to \"completely wipe out PJAK\" in his\\njurisdiction. According to Alunedi, the scholar at\\nGeorgetown, Taab was involved in recent cross-border\\nassassinations of Iranian Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. The\\nKurdish weekly Awena reported that Taab and his unit\\nassassinated two Kurds on December 15, 2008.\\nAccording to the former officer and the Sanandaj official,\\nTaab\\'s criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling in 2007,\\nwhen he made his first forays into murder. Koolbars, the petty\\nborder smugglers, are often killed by land mines or fatally\\nshot by border police. So Taab concocted a scheme to kidnap\\nkoolbars as well as ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish\\ncivilians, dress them in the uniforms of PJAK insurgents and\\nthen kill them—claiming they\\'d died in a military clash—in\\norder to collect a bounty, as high as $40,000 a head, from his\\nsuperiors in the Revolutionary Guards. He was assisted in this\\nplot by at least nine others, seven of whom have been\\napprehended. The article in Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named\\nall seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan of Kermansha,\\nidentified as a ringleader.\\nPJAK has officially denied involvement in these border\\nclashes, including in a May 3, 2009, post to the Iranian\\nwebsite Tabnak, which is published by Mohsen Rezai, a\\nformer head of the Revolutionary Guards. Many of the PJAK\\nclashes may, in fact, have been \"bogus,\" said the Sanandaj\\nofficial. \"More or less no clashes with PJAK have been\\nreported in the area since Heyva Taab and his gang were\\nbusted.\"\\nA mother of one koolbar tearfully described her son\\'s\\ndisappearance. She said he went missing the same day in\\nearly 2009 that the government later claimed a clash with\\nPJAK had taken place. The woman, a resident of a border\\ntown in Iranian Kurdistan, is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits\\nagainst Taab; she asked that her name and location not be\\nmentioned, for fear that it would harm her case in court.\\nTaab\\'s scheme was wildly successful, according to the\\nSanandaj official, who said one bank account under Taab\\'s\\nname has had nearly $6 million deposited in it since 2008.\\nThis macabre scheme ended only in the spring of 2009, when\\nTaab killed a local official\\'s brother who was seeking work in\\nthe area and, more decisively, last July when he killed the\\ncleric\\'s son.\\nOn June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general of\\nIran\\'s High Council for Human Rights, said that the\\ngovernment\\'s investigation was nearly complete and a trial\\nfor Bauer, Fattal and Shourd \"should not be very far from\\nnow.\" In a statement issued on June 17, the mothers of the\\nhikers called on Iran either to prosecute or release their\\nchildren. \"Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not to\\nrelease them or move forward with a fair trial in which our\\nchildren can openly answer any allegations against them.\"\\n\"These new revelations, if indeed true, show the hikers have\\nbeen victims of political machinations and manipulation,\"\\nsaid Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International\\nCampaign for Human Rights in Iran. \"The fact that they have\\nbeen held for so long without prosecution strongly supports\\nthis trend. Under Iranian laws, they have committed no crime\\nand should be released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer,\\nwho has studied the judicial files against them, has\\nconsistently maintained the only charge against them is illegal\\nentry, which is subject to a fine and not arbitrary detention for\\nso long.

GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN\\nIran has accused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in July 2009 and is still holding two of\\nthem in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day when\\nthe hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized.\\nThe initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq said\\nthat the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers were\\nclose to the border but on the Iraqi side.\\nThe episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, a\\nmountainous area with a dramatic waterfall. One American, Shon Meckfessel, became ill and stayed behind when his\\nfriends — Shane M. Bauer, Joshua F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd — set out on July 31.\\nA July 31 field report states that Mr. Meckfessel learned of the arrests when a \"female called him saying they were being\\nsurrounded by armed men.\"\\nAt first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Army\\ndivision based in northern Iraq, the report notes, initially described the event as a \"kidnapping\" and said the three\\nAmerican tourists \"were being taken to the Iranian border.\"\\nThe report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained\\n— all on the Iraqi side of the border.\\nAs documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared to\\nsupport the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraft\\nwas sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forces\\nwere sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning.\\nAs the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force in\\nnorthern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens \"for being too close to the border.\" The July report\\nreflects some frustration with the hikers for their \"lack of coordination\" in venturing to northern Iraq and offers some\\nthoughts on the episode\\'s broader implications.\\n\"The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal\\ndissension,\" it notes. Read the Document >>David Miliband lost by less than 2 percent to his brother Ed. Ed is the new leader. David was marginally hurt by Tony\\'s\\nbook but more by Mandelson\\'s endorsement coupled with his harsh statements about the left. This is something of a\\nregression.\\nSidBill wants to go to church at 10:15 so can we do btw 12 and 7 ?Ed beat Davis by 1.3 percent. Ed\\'s acceptance speech to Labour conference says that the party was betrayed on Iraq and\\nthat trust was lost as a result. \"I get it,\" he said. He sets his goal to the party: \"Win back your trust.\" Very clear repudiation\\nof Tony. He ends: \"Turns the page.. .the work of the new generation begins.\" SidEd Miliband\\'s victory was carried by an anti-Blair undercurrent. In the first round voting, David was ahead. But when the\\nvotes of Ed Balls was distributed to the second choice of voters, they put Ed over. Balls represents Gordon, but even\\nmore a distancing from New Labour. Ed\\'s use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of the repudiation of New Labour. Ed had\\nmore labor union votes for leader, which accounted for one-third of total. Ed\\'s \"new generation\" rhetoric covers that\\nregression and continuing reactive impulse. Now the shadow cabinet, due to a new decision, will be elected by the party.\\nEd is the former environment minister and good on green issues, of course, but has no foreign policy perspective\\nyet instinctively to the left, which means anti-Afghanistan mission as currently conceived, it should go without saying.\\nDavid lost precisely because he held responsible positions.\\nSidH <hrod17@clintonemail.com>\\nSunday, February 21, 2010 12:13 PM\\n\\'abedinh@state.gov\\'\\nRe:\\nAsked me to call back with details.

To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn\\'t see -\\nwould be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,\\nit rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,\\nmanagement, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite\\nconceivably confront tens of thousands of children\\'s deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,\\ntyphoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major\\ntakeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)\\ncould to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the\\nnear and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I\\nwould have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with\\ngrammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.\\nPlease do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me\\nfirst - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.\\nThanks,\\nChelsea\\nTakeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of\\nimportance. Bolded what I think most important.:\\nHaitians want to help themselves and want the international community to\\nhelp them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn\\'t to some of the\\nUN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I\\nencountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off\\nLogbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and\\nincompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me\\nshe was waiting for the Haitians to \"demand their political rights\" - when\\nthey\\'re asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)\\nIn fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,\\nin part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/\\nINGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures\\nhave already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie\\nVincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head\\nof the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a\\nwomen\\'s committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a\\nsoap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of\\nthe most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of\\nthe security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2\\nwomen from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100\\ntshirts - at least though I think they\\'ll need at least 2-3x that - so that the\\nsecurity volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,\\nparticularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups\\nof 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.\\nFinally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less\\nimportant than the first two \\'asks\\'). IF that option were not feasible, their\\nsecond choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at\\nnight. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They\\nwanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.\\nThe settlements\\' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are\\nbeginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate\\ntheir needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents\\nand latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to\\nanyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement\\nresidents themselves\\nThe Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still\\nlargely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the\\nnear (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while\\nrebuilding over next -5 years)\\nThe Haitian government\\'s inability to articulate its plan quickly enough\\nor in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a\\nproliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to \\'help,\\' some of\\nwhich have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water\\nsupplies in camps even though it\\'s a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,\\nIMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the\\nlargest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for\\n-40k though given the settlements\\' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k\\ntoday; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some\\nwhich have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at\\nnight are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;\\nsettlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night\\nwhile most sit in darkness)\\nThis disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects\\non the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced\\nitself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day\\nthe Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was\\n\"such a waste of time\" and he said that is representative of the government\\'s\\ncurrent modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was\\nimproving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings\\nwere \"more efficient.\" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible\\nconsistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs\\nby the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The\\nformer feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very\\nfew actor(s) reliably show up\\nAgain, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled\\naround in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements\\nor workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;\\nno evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding\\naround however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I\\nasked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au\\nPrince UN \\'bases\\' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO\\naccessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,\\nfor instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the\\n\"UN\" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how\\nmany the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and\\ncars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by\\nUNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally\\nacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements\\' residents, by\\nHaitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its\\nnarrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its\\nreliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other\\ncentral locations\\nThere is NO accountability in the UN system or international\\nhumanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news\\nbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there\\nis no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the\\n40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn\\'t tell the residents when they\\nwould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of\\nthe latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British\\nRed Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross\\nsubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ \\'do\\' latrines\\nThe cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to\\nput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -\\nimportant no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the\\nsettlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for\\nsettlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have\\nalready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean\\nlatrines; \\'guard\\' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on\\nsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ\\ndrop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we\\nwere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it\\nappeared - on rubble cleaning.\\nRe: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the\\nresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they\\'re starting to\\nwork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the\\ncamps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli\\nAgency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4\\nsettlements for at least the next month.\\nThe World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is\\nprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and\\ngrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic\\nin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more\\nsystematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet\\nstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for\\nnext week.\\nIn contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on\\nthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see\\nguarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given\\ntheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are\\ncovered in parts of downtown with anti \\'ONG\\' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.\\n(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian\\ndoctors I met said, \"We must be so poor we can\\'t tell them [UN and INGOs]\\nwhat to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.\"). There is also\\ngreat fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-\\nthat the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total\\norganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The\\nUN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.\\nOn an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church\\'s efforts is\\nnotable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and\\nseminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.\\nThoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this\\nis familiar.):\\nThe Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN\\nand all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective\\nauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the\\ncollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know\\nyou know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,\\notherwise it could be \"empowered\" to do this but it ostensibly already is.\\nHowever, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a\\nsingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground\\norganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,\\nlatrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent\\nsettlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project\\nmanagement etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-\\ncutting (e.g., pay for work)\\nThere needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from\\nthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,\\ntents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,\\nmaintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse\\ncoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I\\ntalked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.\\nA plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,\\nparticularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions\\nlike where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food\\nand water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those\\nplaces be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent\\nstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?\\nOn pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with\\nrelevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in\\nthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent\\nwages until a \\'market\\' could develop\\nThe UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the\\nsettlements at the minimum\\nSpeaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials\\nin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.\\nFor example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were\\ncollectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just\\nsitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to\\nlocals) laying effectively fallow - and I don\\'t think anyone expects an\\noutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they\\nand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely\\npreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At\\nthe least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince\\nSpecial/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have\\nreceived significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general\\nhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have\\nnow offered to rebuild\\nHolistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both\\nactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help\\naugment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible\\nThe UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners\\nwhenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work\\nwith local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any\\nsurvived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,\\netc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term\\nthat should accommodate a local dimension\\nRe: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission\\nshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work\\non the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for\\nnon-earthquake related cases.\\nRe: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a\\nsuccession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the\\nHaitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at\\nleast Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what\\nthe transfer plan is\\nRe: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-\\nexperienced chaos on Sunday\\nRe: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking\\nabout this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -\\nbut still unclear what the action plan is\\nRe: Haitian plan: I am not sure it\\'s the best plan, but it is a plan and we\\nshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and\\nactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all\\nRe: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic\\ngroups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary\\nexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary?

I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in\\nHealth (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday\\nafternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region\\nSaturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul\\'s formal meetings in Port Au Prince\\nwith: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian\\ngovernment official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison\\nLeslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs\\nassessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving \\'voice to\\nthe voiceless,\\' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices\\nof those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of\\nCheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in\\nbuilding a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,\\nincluding people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling\\nwith, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person\\nwho donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,\\nClinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to\\nmove goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in\\nsettlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian\\ndoctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,\\nnurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc\\nresidence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our\\nnights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers\\n(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,\\nas mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on\\nand off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,\\nhead of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.Have I written the family a condolence letter?Nope.Is the UAE FM is meeting w Bill Burns before my lunch w him? If so when and where?\\nWhat happened to the idea of my going by dinner at WH? Any other way I could see the CEOs who will be here?Print this, not the first version.Cc: Cheryl, Doug, Justin\\nThere is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I\\nthink it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I\\ndidn\\'t see and whom I didn\\'t meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear\\nlimitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn\\'t see -\\nwould be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,\\nit rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,\\nmanagement, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite\\nconceivably confront tens of thousands of children\\'s deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,\\ntyphoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major\\ntakeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)\\ncould do to drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the\\nnear and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I\\nwould have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with\\ngrammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.\\nPlease do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me\\nfirst - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.\\nThanks,\\nChelsea\\nTakeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of\\nimportance. Bolded what I think most important.:\\n- Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to\\nhelp them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn\\'t to some of the\\nUN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I\\nencountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off\\nLogbase in days - or ever), anachronistic in their thinking at best and\\narrogant and incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN - UNDP I\\nthink - told me she was waiting for the Haitians to \"demand their political\\nrights\" - when they\\'re asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting\\nthat....)\\nIn fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,\\nin part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/\\nINGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures\\nhave already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie\\nVincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head\\nof the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a\\nwomen\\'s committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a\\nsoap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of\\nthe most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of\\nthe security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2\\nwomen from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100\\ntshirts -though I think they\\'ll need at least 2-3x that - so that the security\\nvolunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people, particularly\\nwomen, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3.\\nThey also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally, they\\nwanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less important\\nthan the first two `asks\\'). IF that option were not feasible, their second choice\\nwas for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not the\\nHaitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to help\\nthemselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability from their\\npartners.\\nThe settlements\\' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are\\nbeginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate\\ntheir needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents\\nand latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to\\nanyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement\\nresidents themselves\\nThe Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still\\nlargely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the\\nnear (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while\\nrebuilding over next -5 years)\\nThe Haitian government\\'s inability to articulate its plan quickly enough\\nor in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a\\nproliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to \\'help,\\' some of\\nwhich have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water\\nsupplies in camps even though it\\'s a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,\\nIMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the\\nlargest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for\\n-40k though given the settlements\\' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k\\ntoday; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some\\nwhich have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at\\nnight are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;\\nsettlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night\\nwhile most sit in darkness)\\nThis disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects\\non the Haitian government, including that it has now visibly distanced\\nitself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day\\nthe Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was\\n\"such a waste of time\" and he said that is representative of the government\\'s\\ncurrent modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was\\nimproving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings\\nwere \"more efficient.\" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible\\nconsistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs\\nby the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The\\nformer feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very\\nfew actor(s) reliably show up\\nAgain, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled\\naround in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements\\nor workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;\\nno evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding\\naround however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I\\nasked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au\\nPrince UN \\'bases\\' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO\\naccessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,\\nfor instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the\\n\"UN\" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how\\nmany the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and\\ncars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by\\nUNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally\\nacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements\\' residents, by\\nHaitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its\\nnarrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its\\nreliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other\\ncentral locations\\nThere is NO accountability in the UN system or international\\nhumanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news\\nbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there\\nis no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the\\n40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn\\'t tell the residents when they\\nwould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of\\nthe latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British\\nRed Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross\\nsubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ \\'do\\' latrines\\nThe cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to\\nput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -\\nimportant no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the\\nsettlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for\\nsettlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have\\nalready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean\\nlatrines; \\'guard\\' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on\\nsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ\\ndrop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we\\nwere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it\\nappeared - on rubble cleaning.\\nRe: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the\\nresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they\\'re starting to\\nwork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the\\ncamps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli\\nAgency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4\\nsettlements for at least the next month.\\nThe World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is\\nprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and\\ngrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic\\nin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more\\nsystematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet\\nstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for\\nnext week.\\nIn contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on\\nthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see\\nguarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given\\ntheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are\\ncovered in parts of downtown with anti \\'ONG\\' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.\\n(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian\\ndoctors I met said, \"We must be so poor we can\\'t tell them [UN and INGOs]\\nwhat to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.\"). There is also\\ngreat fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-\\nthat the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total\\norganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The\\nUN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.\\nOn an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church\\'s efforts is\\nnotable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and\\nseminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.\\nThoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this\\nis familiar.):\\nThe Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN\\nand all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective\\nauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the\\ncollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know\\nyou know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,\\notherwise it could be \"empowered\" to do this but it ostensibly already is.\\nHowever, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a\\nsingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground\\norganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,\\nlatrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent\\nsettlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project\\nmanagement etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-\\ncutting (e.g., pay for work)\\nThere needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from\\nthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,\\ntents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,\\nmaintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse\\ncoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I\\ntalked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.\\nA plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,\\nparticularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions\\nlike where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food\\nand water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those\\nplaces be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent\\nstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?\\nOn pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with\\nrelevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in\\nthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent\\nwages until a \\'market\\' could develop\\nThe UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the\\nsettlements at the minimum\\nSpeaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials\\nin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.\\nFor example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were\\ncollectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just\\nsitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to\\nlocals) laying effectively fallow - and I don\\'t think anyone expects an\\noutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they\\nand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely\\npreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At\\nthe least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince\\nSpecial/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have\\nreceived significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general\\nhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have\\nnow offered to rebuild\\nHolistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both\\nactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help\\naugment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible\\nThe UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners\\nwhenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work\\nwith local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any\\nsurvived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,\\netc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term\\nthat should accommodate a local dimension\\nRe: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission\\nshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work\\non the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for\\nnon-earthquake related cases.\\nRe: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a\\nsuccession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the\\nHaitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at\\nleast Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what\\nthe transfer plan is\\nRe: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-\\nexperienced chaos on Sunday\\nRe: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking\\nabout this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -\\nbut still unclear what the action plan is\\nRe: Haitian plan: I am not sure it\\'s the best plan, but it is a plan and we\\nshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and\\nactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all\\nRe: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic\\ngroups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary\\nexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would\\nbe a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work\\nRe: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and\\nex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can\\'t process right now\\nFYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:\\no Near term/ for the next year\\n■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not\\nin the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in\\nplace, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or\\nbeing brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security\\nand safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);\\nensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the\\nyoungest children.\\n■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst\\ngeographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other\\nreasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime\\nminister\\'s lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements\\nelsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO\\nShelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close\\nto one another\\n■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above\\ndiscussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go\\nwhen the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services\\nonce the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how\\nto ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to\\nsecurity (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least\\n2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec\\nof tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,\\nschool and what could be multipurpose; plan for older\\nchildren/young adults who may be too old for initial school\\nplan; how to best support / help create where needed\\nsettlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,\\nwho is in the settlements\\n■ Over next 6-12 months:\\n• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families\\nto return to and subsequently encourage them to do\\nso; government estimates this will be —30% of all\\nhomes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no\\nevidence base)\\n• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-\\nexisting villages around Port Au Prince where\\nfeasible to enable the government to move people\\nout of settlements to those sites.

At the time, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Kay Bailey\\nHutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined with Democrats to\\novercome strong Republican opposition to the bill.\\nBut today, all three Republican senators voted against a motion to\\nproceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that \"would further\\nstrengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination.\" The\\nmotion was defeated by a vote of 58-41, falling two votes short of the 60\\nneeded for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor.\\nThis is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in the\\nSenate. In 2008, the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it was\\napproved by the House, which passed the legislation again in 2009 with\\nthe support of 10 Republicans.\\nWomen earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts make\\nfor the same work, but conservatives have invented a number of\\nludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For example, the\\nHeritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurt\\nwomen because businesses simply won\\'t hire them if they are required to\\npay them fair wages. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has claimed that\\nwomen would receive better compensation if they just had more\\n\"education and training.\"am today\\nOk.

Sid\\n0\\naptember 26, 2010\\nJohn Rentoul: The party voted for David\\nMiliband but got the Panda instead\\nNew Labour leader won\\'t stand a chance against David\\nCameron\\nThe result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. The\\nparty would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader\\'s legitimacy\\nunchallenged.\\nInstead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labour\\'s electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Party\\nmembers, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.\\nIf he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. He is soft, cuddly and\\npanders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of which\\nhe was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, the\\nthird runway for Heathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he had\\ndirect ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared to\\nditch.\\nBut that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itself\\nvoted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the \"New Labour Establishment\", in other words, the supposedly hated\\nBlairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didn\\'t do as badly as it feared in the\\ngeneral election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board Tony Blair\\'s warning that\\nLabour lost because Gordon Brown \"moved a millimetre\" to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument that\\nLabour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a\\ncouple of centimetres further to the left.\\nThey did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know\\nthat the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also\\nknow that Labour\\'s poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest\\nparty, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.\\nThe Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.\\nThat means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event,\\nis going to be roasted every week.\\nEvery week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the\\nmembers on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the\\ncountry. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the\\nbeneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.\\nIf Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have\\nteased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party\\nactivists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the \"cork-popper\" candidate in Conservative HQ. The way\\nthings have turned out, that\\'s not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron,\\nlucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.\\nEven if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour\\'s electoral college, I feel he would have struggled\\nagainst Cameron. This way, I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back.Not yet.Good work.Did you want to do another call before the 1115?Makes a good case. Should we include policy?I agree that this is a great idea and want to pursue. Thx.Not until I have a report from Mitchell.

While conflict is a constant in human\\nhistory, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been\\ntransformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:\\n\"The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to\\nbe timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old\\nweapons; the sides are mostly non-state.\"2\\nThe nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must\\nsimultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and\\nRichard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat\\nholds the key to the world\\'s future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our\\nresponses.3\\nThe definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success\\nwill encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest\\nsimultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding\\nPhilip Bobbitt\\'s concept of \"preclusive victory,\" which he describes as \"anticipatory,\\nprecautionary attention to possible futures,\" requiring an expansive and integrated approach to\\nmodern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce\\npreclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the\\npreparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and\\npromote political and economic pluralism after conflict.\\nDiplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and\\nits aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State\\nDepartment from 1993 to 1997 as the Department\\'s Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador\\nto Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as\\nAssistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political\\nAffairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to\\ndiscuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to\\nprevent conflict, diplomacy\\'s role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the\\ncontribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.\\nDiplomacy and Conflict Prevention\\nThanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods\\nand theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow\\nWilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a\\nleadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present\\nuncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted\\ninternational conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon\\narrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities\\nare assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their\\nresponsibilities.\\' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to \"coordinate and\\nrationalize\" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of\\npreventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,\\nor the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different\\norganizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6\\nAn example of conflict prevention that meets Lund\\'s tests was the effort undertaken by the\\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union\\n(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the\\nUnited States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until\\nSeptember 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international\\nheadline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable\\npersonal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson\\nand the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former\\nNATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,\\nSolana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin\\nPowell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,\\nthe EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid\\nFramework Agreement.\\nAs a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about\\nmodern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for\\npersonal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off\\nviolence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century\\ndiplomats who can act \"unconventionally\"), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate\\nforce quickly.\\'\\nDiplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable\\nWhen diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new\\nrequirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to\\naddress the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and\\nimperative.\\nThe February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the\\nworld that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using\\nmilitary force to stop Slobodan Milosevic\\'s attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant\\nSecretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first\\nday or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart\\nRambouillet and leave the \"negotiating\" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not\\nbeing present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an\\noutcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.\\nAlbright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also\\nprepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be\\nexhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,\\nincluding her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further\\nexcuses against taking military action.\\nSecretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.\\nBaker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had\\nconcluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister\\nTariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America\\'s commitment to avoiding\\nwar if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the\\nadministration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for\\nconflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq\\'s withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the\\nadministration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President\\'s offer\\nturned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts,\\n\"I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of\\ndays, we would be at war.\"8\\nIn 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from\\nAfghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a\\nmenace— but \"in a box,\" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should\\nbe kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq\\nhad been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning\\nof the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for\\n\"smart\" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.\\nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the\\nNixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a\\nconsciousness of what the other side will accept.\\' Kissinger did not consider this trait a\\nparticular positive at the time, and the department\\'s culture of negotiability did not serve as a\\ngood guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the\\ninteragency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding\\n1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle\\nEast and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to\\ninstitutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency\\ndebate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath\\nassuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict\\ninto successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring\\nof 2003.\\nThe State Department\\'s Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was\\n\"60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they\\nlost out on a 60:40 decision.\"\\' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of\\nmass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the\\nwar.\\nAnd no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to\\ntry to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that\\nthe United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force\\nin the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create\\na broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international\\ncoalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it\\nwould never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in\\nIraq.\\nDiplomacy in Preparation for Conflict\\nOnce conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military\\ncommanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest\\ncasualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States\\npursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal\\'s support\\nof American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the\\nwhole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a\\nsuccessful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and\\nsupport for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of\\nAfghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding\\nAfghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first\\ntime in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition\\nforces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.\\nBefore the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar\\neffort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General\\nTommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit\\nAmerican, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military\\ncommanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public\\ndiplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American\\ndiplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to\\nconvince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern\\nfront in the battle against Saddam\\'s forces. Although the State Department worried about the\\nsize of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both\\ncivilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified\\nby the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not\\novercome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to\\nthe war.\\nThe way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes\\nand actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.\\nMilitary force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.\\nAs Rupert Smith writes, \"We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a\\nresolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level\\nour objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their\\nterritory or forces.\"\\' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-\\nmilitary decisions is \"deeply problematic\" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his\\nbook, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and\\nMinistry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a\\nnumber of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.\\nFCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?\\nMOD: What do you want us to do?\\nFCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can\\'t have people being massacred. As a\\npermanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.\\nMOD: So you want us to use military force?\\nFCO: Yes.\\nMOD: To do what? To stop the killing?\\nFCO: Yes. Exactly.\\nMOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on\\ntribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?\\nKigali, presumably, it\\'s the capital and we would want an airhead.\\nFCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.\\nMOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?\\nFCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\\nMOD: Is Britain to lead the force?\\nFCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission.\\nMOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.\\nFCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.\\nMOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our\\ndeployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.\\nFCO: What do you suggest?\\nMOD: What are our government\\'s priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than\\nthese other tasks we are already undertaking?\\nFCO: Probably not.\\nMOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want\\nto speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most\\nvaluable contribution.\\nFCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?\\nMOD: Hardly any.\"\\nMany American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in\\nsomething like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the\\nissue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American\\ncase, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State\\nDepartment\\'s inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces\\nin an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national\\ninterests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the\\nworld was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to\\nunderstandable consternation among those in uniform.\\nDiplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict\\nThere are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of\\nglobalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,\\nnonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But\\ngetting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be\\nthe most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined\\nafter the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and\\neconomic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time\\nand patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and\\n\"fatigue\" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners\\nand losers; today\\'s lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.\\nRupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:\\nWe intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in\\nwhich the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to\\ncreate a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other\\nmeasures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a\\ndecisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition\\nmay be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15\\nSmith\\'s point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a\\nmilitary operation carried out following Smith\\'s rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to\\ncreate the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a\\ntypical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of\\nresponsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic\\nfoot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between\\neach individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing\\ncomparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by\\nfunction rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16\\nPostconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career\\nat the State Department.\\nIn the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains\\nbetween Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands\\neach day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of\\nAmbassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces\\nand then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated\\nOperation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a\\n\"whole-of-government\" but a \"whole-of-theinternational- community\" campaign to provide\\nhumanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,\\nthey needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including\\nTurkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this\\narea from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.\\nThese years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,\\nsome of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my\\nresidence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke\\'s successors as Assistant\\nSecretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and\\nJames Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in\\npostconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of\\nState for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and\\nnationbuilding in Kosovo.\\nOther postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources\\nof the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for\\ndevelopment and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to\\nfocus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,\\ndemobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict\\nsociety. But the main events in modern diplomacy\\'s postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and\\nIraq.\\nThe key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the\\nprofound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about\\nwhether the United States should engage in \"nationbuilding,\" a policy President Bush had\\ncampaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort\\nthe United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment\\nof U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in\\nthe Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the\\nBalkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective\\nlong-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.\\nThe effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of\\nclassical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.\\'8 Secretary Powell directed\\nAmbassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in\\n2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,\\nincluding representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put\\nHamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.\\' But, as Dobbins has written, the \"Bush\\nAdministration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,\\ndetermined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other\\ncountries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security\\nthroughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that\\nAfghanistan had no army and no police force.\"2°\\nThe struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of\\nU.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of\\nresponsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming\\nthe justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing\\nbut did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on\\nAfghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including\\nKosovo.\\' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years\\nfaced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22\\nThe State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning\\nfor postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from\\nthe first Gulf War. The department\\'s Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have\\nsolved Iraq\\'s postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the\\nimmediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order\\ncreating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.\\nThere is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by\\nothers in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins\\'s argument that, looking\\nback, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances\\nis worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on\\nbudget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more\\ncomprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.\\nThere is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have\\nadequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for\\nInternational Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article\\' by Ambassador\\nJohn Herbst, the Secretary of State\\'s Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),\\nhis office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability\\noperations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.\\nThe Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a\\nreserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel\\nare anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,\\ncorrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health\\nofficials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active\\nand standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core\\ngroup of domestic U.S. Agencies.\\nOnce congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments\\nand the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11\\ncountries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250\\nactive members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now\\nat least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding\\ncapacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or\\n\"comprehensive\" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have\\nhigher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America\\'s.25\\nOne way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new\\npersonnel specialty: the \"expeditionary diplomat.\" Washington\\'s diplomatic personnel have, of\\ncourse, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed\\nabroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the\\neffort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the\\nexpeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but\\nsignificant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment\\'s notice.\\nExperience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons\\nlearned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest\\nposts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first\\nrequirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central\\nIntelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special\\ncareer path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an\\ninvestment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask\\ndiplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more\\nthan one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the\\nsame age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department\\ncould allow people to opt in and out of this \"special force\" during their careers as long as they\\nhave the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those\\nwho desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The\\ndepartment would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a\\ncareer beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.\\nThe creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for\\nthe future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID\\ncommitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered\\nabout civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State\\nDepartment—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable\\ncontingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the\\nlines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no\\nquestion that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration\\'s focus on diplomacy,\\ndevelopment, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation.\\nIf we combine the observations made by several authors,\\' we arrive at this question: What\\nnational policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the\\nconditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-\\nconflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we\\nwill) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not\\nhave to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern\\nAmerican diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable\\nfuture, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from\\nGermany to Iraq.\" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the\\nelements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close\\ncoordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip\\nBobbitt has written, \"The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture\\nunfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace\\nbuilding by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare,\\nhowever, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.\"\\'\\nWhile the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed\\nindividually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the\\nanswer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith\\nwrites at the end of his volume:\\nFor the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the\\npeople and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of\\naction when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state\\npossessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the *\\nterrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a\\ncondition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a\\nlever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to\\nbe effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one\\ngoal.3°\\nThe connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy,\\nworking to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the\\nconsequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out\\nby well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by\\neffective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.\\nThe author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to consider\\nthese issues and to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the\\nHarvard John F.

Nobody I spoke with\\nbelieved that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its\\nexpiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a\\nlarge majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him\\nleverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud\\nvoters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state\\nsolution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).\\nLieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi\\'s chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as\\npossible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,\\nwho oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to\\nkeep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the\\ngovernment now, and is willing to do so without any demand for \"rotation,\" provided Bibi is serious about\\nnegotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against\\nthe idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows\\nKadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.\\nTherefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The\\nlonger he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to\\noppose him in the next elections.\\nIn this context, Bibi\\'s negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that\\nhe is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the\\nbelief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable\\nprice uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises\\ndoubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final\\nconcession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no\\ncredit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This\\ncombines with his legendary fear of being seen as a \"freier\" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real\\nproblem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.\\nThis is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of \"creative ideas.\" Thinking out of the box, as he\\nlikes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to\\nbroaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct\\nnegotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.\\nThe reason for dwelling on Bibi\\'s psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of\\nmaking a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn\\'t make a serious move, it will further\\ndelegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President\\nObama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling\\nrelations with the U.S.; and if he doesn\\'t make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance\\nthe future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.\\nYuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky\\n(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent\\nterror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will\\ndisappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi\\ndoesn\\'t quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been\\nseriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but\\nthat Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.\\nWhat is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And\\nplease forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.\\n1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working\\nwith him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge\\nhim forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.\\n2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own\\npurposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel\\'s security,\\nfrom the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted\\nBibi\\'s security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.\\n3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in\\nterms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about\\nAbu Mazen\\'s politics.\\n4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a \"clarifying moment.\" The world will of course blame\\nBibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated\\nsolution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they\\'re ready. The\\nIsraeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and\\nthey should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations\\nand time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as\\nwe keep the door open.\\nFrom my staffer:\\nAM\\nAnne-Marie Slaughter\\nDirector of Policy Planning\\nU.S. Department of State\\n(202) 647-2972Bill--My husband cannot go w PM Putin in mid-April because of his schedule, but he would be very interested in doing\\nsuch events w the PM in the future.

The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for the\\nState Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their\\nstrategy and priorities.\\nThe new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. Both\\nClinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about \"demilitarizing\" foreign policy, and Clinton\\nsays the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development,\\nmuch of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.\\nIn the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to be\\nimplemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.\\ngovernment agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that\\ndevelopment undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and \"sustainable\" impact.\\n\"Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the\\nworld will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States\\'\\nnational security strategy,\" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development was\\nto \"put itself out of business\" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.\\nPresident Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United Nations\\nGeneral Assembly when he released the \"U.S. Global Development Policy,\" which changes U.S. efforts to focus on\\nbuilding up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.\\nBut the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detail\\neverything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes\\n\"stabilization\" efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the\\ntypes and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.\\nAmerican diplomats going forward, Clinton said, are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.You\\'ll love this.

Gelb\\nNovember 30, 2010 I 10:42pm\\nJulian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie\\nH. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite.\\nThe Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked—but their\\nrevelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you\\nclearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most\\ndangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers\\nand diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from\\nforeign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on allies\\nand adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with\\ncowardice and hypocrisy.\\nDon\\'t think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did he\\ntoss in those cables about Italy\\'s leader being a rake and Germany\\'s chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and\\nPresident Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being \"paranoid\"? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention, and\\nhe got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. Did\\nAssange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by the\\nhair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopeless\\nleft-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time to\\ncome. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant went out\\nand told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems.\\nThese leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.\\nWhen you actually read the cables, here\\'s what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial\\nworld In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he\\'s doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies.\\nHis aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really\\ndoing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency\\'s sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn\\'t see what was\\nplain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange\\ncommentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here\\'s\\nwhat you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.\\nBut when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front\\npages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here\\'s what you see: American leaders and American\\ndiplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.\\n—Washington needs China\\'s help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and\\ngas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the\\nworld wants to slow or even prevent Iran\\'s march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.\\n—\\nThe U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran\\nthrough China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.\\nReally creepy.\\n—\\nYemen\\'s leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to\\ndiminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The \"lie\" by the Yemeni president is\\na harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the\\npolitical cover of Yemen\\'s leaders.\\n—No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching\\ndesperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean\\nPeninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese\\nthinking about North Korean craziness. They won\\'t do that again soon.\\nTime and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of\\nU.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or\\nnot, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you\\nin these materials.\\nSo, the naïve say, it\\'s good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to\\nchoose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.\\nNone of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is\\nnecessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or\\ntelling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let\\'s have it out in public. If the U.S. government is\\nconcocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let\\'s hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.\\nBut the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need for\\nserious policy discussion.

Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Colin L. Powell\\nThursday, December 2, 2010;\\nRepublican presidents have long led the crucial fight to protect the United States against nuclear dangers. That\\nis why Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush negotiated the SALT I, START I and\\nSTART II agreements. It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow Treaty. All four recognized\\nthat reducing the number of nuclear arms in an open, verifiable manner would reduce the risk of nuclear\\ncatastrophe and increase the stability of America\\'s relationship with the Soviet Union and, later, the Russian\\nFederation. The world is safer today because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.\\nAs a result, we urge the Senate to ratify the New START treaty signed by President Obama and Russian\\nPresident Dmitry Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that expired\\nalmost a year ago. It reduces the number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while enabling the United\\nStates to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those forces as we see fit.\\nAlong with our obligation to protect the homeland, the United States has responsibilities to allies around the\\nworld. The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the 1,550 warheads allowed under this treaty are\\nsufficient for all our missions - and seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, the\\nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency - all originally appointed by a\\nRepublican president - argue that New START is essential for our national defense.\\nWe do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for the\\nadministration and Senate leaders. The most important thing is to have bipartisan support for the treaty, as\\nprevious nuclear arms treaties did.\\nAlthough each of us had initial questions about New START, administration officials have provided reasonable\\nanswers. We believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should support ratification.\\nFirst, the agreement emphasizes verification, providing a valuable window into Russia\\'s nuclear arsenal. Since\\nthe original START expired last December, Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes\\nin its strategic nuclear arsenal, and the United States has been unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each day,\\nAmerica\\'s understanding of Russia\\'s arsenal has been degraded, and resources have been diverted from national\\nsecurity tasks to try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight into\\nRussia\\'s activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent\\nmission.\\nSecond, New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies of our military\\ncommanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although\\nthe treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine-based ballistic\\nmissiles, our military leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective than\\nbuilding new ones for defense purposes.\\nFinally, the Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to\\nmaintaining our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification\\nprocess. The administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 billion on the Energy Department\\'s\\nnuclear weapons complex. Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 billion to the originally\\nproposed $70 billion for modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who has been vigilant in\\nthis effort. Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that\\nour nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond.\\nAlthough the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force, the chief nuclear danger today comes not\\nfrom Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall\\ninto the hands of terrorists. Given those pressing dangers, some question why an arms control treaty with Russia\\nmatters. It matters because it is in both parties\\' interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic\\nnuclear relationship. It also matters because Russia\\'s cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in\\nrolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be needed to continue our work to\\nsecure \"loose nukes\" in Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in\\nAfghanistan, a breeding ground for international terrorism.\\nObviously, the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must be\\nconsidered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest, and we should\\nconsider the ramifications of not ratifying it.\\nWhenever New START is brought up for debate, we encourage all senators to focus on national security. There\\nare plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the American economy.\\nWith our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing federal debt bomb, we anticipate\\nsignificant conflict between Democrats and Republicans. It is, however, in the national interest to ratify New\\nSTART.\\nThe writers were secretaries of state for the past five Republican presidents.\\nUnsubscribe\\nThe White House • 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW • Washington DC 20500 • 202-456-1111PIs make 3 copies.FyiFROM WIKILEAKS FOUNDER ASSANGE-----FyiI did and thank you.

Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their\\ncorrespondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give\\nevery journalist pause.\\nSo it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more\\nconspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be\\nadded.\\nJulian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow\\nspectrum. That will satisfy him in that he\\'s a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.\\nPerhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the \"shock\" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni\\nleaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn\\'t disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the\\n\"shock\" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the \"shock\" of yet more premature Israeli predictions\\non when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the \"shock\" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the \"shock\" of the\\nChinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the \"shock\" of Muammar el-Qaddafi\\'s taste for voluptuous Slavic women and\\nSilvio Berlusconi\\'s taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on\\nembarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to\\nthe familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: \"hyperactive,\" \"mercurial,\" \"authoritarian,\" \"erratic,\"\\n\"monarch-like.\"\\nI swear, if they hadn\\'t become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.\\nOverall, my longstanding admiration for America\\'s conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for this\\nunderreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: \"While\\nwe don\\'t know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels\\nand that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad \\'won\\nbig\\' in the first round.\"\\nIt is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran\\nduring the election and its violent aftermath.\\nA couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are about\\nTehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the United\\nStates. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle\\nEast more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.\\nThe second is that President Barack Obama\\'s approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreach\\nsuggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross\\'s tired thinking\\nabout balancing \"appetizing carrots\" with \"sharp sticks\" in tackling Iran\\'s nuclear program.\\nThe cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking \"dual track,\" telling Europeans that\\n\"engagement alone is unlikely to succeed\" and calling for added \"pressure.\" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have\\nbeen overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.\\nAssange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy.

Sid\\nB6\\nSarah Palin is wrong about John F. Kennedy, religion and\\npolitics\\nBy Kathleen Kennedy Townsend\\nFriday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM\\nSarah Palin has found a new opponent to debate: John F. Kennedy.\\nIn her new book, \"America by Heart,\" Palin objects to my uncle\\'s famous 1960 speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial\\nAssociation, in which he challenged the ministers - and the country - to judge him, a Catholic presidential candidate, by\\nhis views rather than his faith. \"Contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,\"\\nKennedy said. \"I am the Democratic Party\\'s candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic.\"\\nPalin writes that when she was growing up, she was taught that Kennedy\\'s speech had \"succeeded in the best possible\\nway: It reconciled public service and religion without compromising either.\" Now, however, she says she has revisited the\\nspeech and changed her mind. She finds it \"defensive . . . in tone and content\" and is upset that Kennedy, rather than\\npresenting a reconciliation of his private faith and his public role, had instead offered an \"unequivocal divorce of the two.\"\\nPalin\\'s argument seems to challenge a great American tradition, enshrined in the Constitution, stipulating that there be no\\nreligious test for public office. A careful reading of her book leads me to conclude that Palin wishes for precisely such a\\ntest. And she seems to think that she, and those who think like her, are qualified to judge who would pass and who would\\nnot.\\nIf there is no religious test, then there is no need for a candidate\\'s religious affiliation to be \"reconciled.\" My uncle urged\\nthat religion be private, removed from politics, because he feared that making faith an arena for public contention would\\nlead American politics into ill-disguised religious warfare, with candidates tempted to use faith to manipulate voters and\\ndemean their opponents.\\nKennedy cited Thomas Jefferson to argue that. as part of the American tradition, it was essential to keep any semblance\\nof a religious test out of the political realm. Best to judge candidates on their public records, their positions on war and\\npeace, jobs, poverty, and health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked those who died at the Alamo which church\\nthey belonged to.\\nBut Palin insists on evaluating and acting as an authority on candidates\\' faith. She faults Kennedy for not \"telling the\\ncountry how his faith had enriched him.\" With that line, she proceeds down a path fraught with danger - precisely the path\\nmy uncle warned against when he said that a president\\'s religious views should be \"neither imposed by him upon the\\nnation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.\"\\nAfter all, a candidate\\'s faith will matter most to those who believe that they have the right to serve as arbiters of that faith.\\nIs it worthy? Is it deep? Is it reflected in a certain ideology?\\nPalin further criticizes Kennedy because, \"rather than spelling out how faith groups had provided life-changing services\\nand education to millions of Americans, he repeatedly objected to any government assistance to religious schools.\" She\\ndoes not seem to appreciate that Kennedy was courageous in arguing that government funds should not be used in\\nparochial schools, despite the temptation to please his constituents. Many Catholics would have liked the money. But he\\nwisely thought that the use of public dollars in places where nuns explicitly proselytized would be unconstitutional. Tax\\nmoney should not be used to persuade someone to join a religion.\\nAs a contrast to Kennedy\\'s speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney\\'s remarks during the 2008\\nRepublican primary campaign, in which he spoke publicly of \"how my own faith would inform my presidency, if I were\\nelected.\" After paying lip service to the separation of church and state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies \"intent on\\nestablishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism.\"\\n\"There is one fundamental question about which I am often asked,\" Romney said. \"What do I believe about Jesus Christ?\"\\nRomney, of course, is a Mormon. He answered the question, proclaiming that \"Jesus Christ is the son of God.\"\\nPalin praises Romney for delivering a \"thoughtful speech that eloquently and correctly described the role of faith in\\nAmerican public life.\" But if there should be no religious test in politics, then why should a candidate feel compelled to\\nrespond to misplaced questions about his belief in Jesus?\\nWhen George Romney, Mitt Romney\\'s father, was a presidential candidate in 1968, he felt no such compulsion. Respect\\nfor the Constitution and the founders\\' belief in the separation of church and state suggests that those kinds of questions\\nshould not play a role in political campaigns.\\nPalin contends that Kennedy sought to \"run away from religion.\" The truth is that my uncle knew quite well that what made\\nAmerica so special was its revolutionary assertion of freedom of religion. No nation on Earth had ever framed in law that\\nfaith should be of no interest to government officials. For centuries, European authorities had murdered and tortured those\\nwhose religious beliefs differed from their own.\\nTo demand that citizens display their religious beliefs attacks the very foundation of our nation and undermines the\\nprecise reason that America is exceptional.\\nPalin\\'s book makes clear just how dangerous her proposed path can be. Not only does she want people to reveal their\\nbeliefs, but she wants to sit in judgment of them if their views don\\'t match her own. For instance, she criticizes Rep. Nancy\\nPelosi (Calif.), a Democrat and a faithful Catholic, for \"talking the (God) talk but not walking the walk.\"\\nWho is Palin to say what God\\'s \"walk\" is? Who anointed her our grand inquisitor?\\nThis is a woman who also praises Abraham Lincoln\\'s Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, \"But let\\nus judge not that we not be judged.\" The problem for those setting up a free-floating tribunal to evaluate faith is that,\\ncontrary to Lincoln, they are installing themselves as judges who can look into others\\' souls and assess their worthiness.\\nKennedy did not and would not do that, but not because he was indifferent to faith. In fact, unlike Romney or Palin, in\\nfealty to both his faith and the Constitution, he promised on that day in Houston that he would resign if his religion ever\\ninterfered with his duty as president.\\nMy uncle was a man who had his faith tested. His brother and brother-in-law were killed in World War II, and his sister\\ndied in a plane crash soon after the war. He suffered from painful injuries inflicted during his Navy service when his PT\\nboat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. His God did not make life easy but did require a commitment to justice.\\nAmerica\\'s first and oniy Catholic president referred to God three times in p_;.-:\\n.:1,rai.adc\\'res and invoked the Bible\\'s\\ncommand to care for poor and the sick. Later in his presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. about riohi:s: We are\\nconfronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.\"\\nFaith runs as a deep current through my family. Faith inspired my uncles\\' and my father\\'s dedication to justice. My father,\\nRobert F. Kennedy, on returning from apartheid-era South Africa in 1966, wrote a magazine article titled \"Suppose God Is -\\nBlack.\" And my uncle Teddy fought for health care for all Americans, even if in her book }Dalin presumes to judge that he\\ntook positions \"directly at odds with his Catholic faith.\"\\nTeddy Kennedy believed that his stands were at one with his faith. He did disagree with the Roman Catholic hierarchy at\\ntimes. But as we have seen, the hierarchy\\'s positions can change, and in our church, we have an obligation to help bring\\nabout those changes. That may not be Palin\\'s theology, but the glory of America is its support for those who would\\ndisagree - even on the most difficult and personal matters, such as religion.\\nJohn F. Kennedy knew that tearing down the wall separating church and state would tempt us toward self-righteousness\\nand contempt for others. That is one reason he delivered his Houston speech.\\nPalin, for her part, argues that \"morality itself cannot be sustained without the support of religious beliefs.\" That statement\\namounts to a wholesale attack on countless Americans, and no study or reasonable argument I have seen or heard would\\nsupport such a blanket condemnation. For a person who claims to admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores his injunction\\nthat Americans, even those engaged in a Civil War, show \"malice toward none, with charity for ail.\"\\nPal in fails to understand the genius of our nation. The United States is one of the most vibrant religious countries on Earth\\nprecisely because of its religious freedom. When power and faith are entwined, faith loses. Power tends to obfuscate,\\ncorrupt and focus on temporal rather than eternal purposes.\\nSomehow Palin misses this. Perhaps she didn\\'t read the full Houston speech; she certainly doesn\\'t know it by heart. Or\\nshe may be appealing to a religious right that really seeks secular power. I don\\'t know.\\nI am certain, however, that no American political leader should cavalierly - or out of political calculation - dismiss the hard-\\nwon ideal of religious freedom that is among our country\\'s greatest gifts to the world. As John F. Kennedy said in Houston,\\nthat is the \"kind of America I believe in.\"\\nKathleen Kennedy Townsend is a former lieutenant governor of Maryland and the author of \"Failing America\\'s Faithful:\\nHow Today\\'s Churches Are Mixing God With Politics and Losing Their Wav.\" She will be online on Monday, Dec. 6 at 11\\na.m. EST to chat.

But the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the\\nwake of America\\'s 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United States\\nand Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses.\\nBreaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment\\nof a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real\\nthreat was that the world\\'s most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the world\\'s most dangerous\\nregimes—or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And since those very rogue states also\\npursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be integral to the security of the United States\\nand our allies.\\nIt is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national security.\\nThe treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1,550 on each side—more than enough for deterrence.\\nWhile the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain a\\ntriad of bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the treaty helpfully\\nreinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty last\\nyear.\\nMeaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and its\\nreinstatement is crucial.\\nStill, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if the\\ntreaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama administration\\'s commitments.\\nFirst, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona has\\nled a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department of\\nEnergy\\'s nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments, and Congress should fully\\nfund the president\\'s program.\\nCongress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defense\\nstrategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser Stephen\\nHadley.\\nSecond, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the Cold War\\nlink between offensive forces and missile defenses. New Start\\'s preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes the\\n\"interrelationship\" of the two. Administration officials have testified that there is no link, and that the treaty will not\\nlimit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this.\\nMoscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must remain\\nfully free to explore and then deploy the best defenses—not just those imagined today. That includes pursuing both\\npotential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases.\\nI have personally witnessed Moscow\\'s tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians\\nneed to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability to\\nintercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.\\nRussia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by our\\nmissile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently\\nbetween NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field.\\nAfter all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States, but to international stability broadly.\\nRatification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscow\\'s cooperation on other issues. The men in the\\nKremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists—some who operate in Russia\\'s unstable south—are dangerous.\\nThat alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat from\\ntactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. Russia\\nknows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Korea\\'s arsenal is not in its\\ninterest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscow\\'s toughening stance toward Tehran and its\\nlongstanding concern about Pyongyang.\\nThe issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in America\\'s future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us for a\\nlong time.\\nAfter this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferators—not on further reductions in the U.S. and\\nRussian strategic arsenals, which are really no threat to each other or to international stability.\\nA modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclear\\nsecurity (and that of our allies) going forward. With the right commitments and understandings, ratification of the New\\nStart treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate enters those commitments and understandings into the record of\\nratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether in the lame-duck session or next year.\\nMs. Rice, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a senior fellow at Stanford\\'s\\nHoover Institution, was U.S. national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 and U.S. secretary of state from 2005 to 2009.I just want to say that as I brief the QDDR (20 times and counting), one of the points that makes\\nthe strongest impression, and that I frankly think is an enormous part of your intellectual and\\npractical legacy, is putting together all the bureaus that focus on protecting individuals — protecting\\nthem from insurgent or criminal violence (CCO and INL), protecting their rights through law\\n(DRL, GTIP, S/WCI), or meeting their basic needs in humanitarian emergencies (PRM).

Last year, a friend of mine was invited to a\\nHanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after the\\nObamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook a\\nfew hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.\\nIn their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people were\\nhurting, especially Michelle\\'s extravagant trip to Spain. (I\\'m as interested in Michelle\\'s clothes as the next woman but at\\nthe same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. Her wardrobe seems\\nquite extensive for these troubled times.)\\nBarack Obama\\'s personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self-\\nesteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, some\\nof whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. °barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group,\\nand three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had had no experience in\\ngoverning. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word that\\nhe offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.\\nVice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol Hill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the\\nfirst two years—\"I can handle them,\" Obama told Biden—but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the\\nWhite House\\'s new determination to \"reach out.\" (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they\\nwould \"reach out,\" but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama\\'s persona is that\\nsomeone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be\\n\"comfortable.\"\\nFor example, Torn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by all\\naccounts a capable man but is no one\\'s idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon\\'s\\nbeing given his new position was that \"the President is comfortable with him.\" Just as Obama is described as pleased with\\nhimself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons,\\nand, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to those\\nwho had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there\\nwere no \"grown-ups\" around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.\\nWhen people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as \"not one of ours.\" Joe\\nBiden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the White\\nHouse....\\nThose who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. The\\nfact that the Obama White House has been so poor at \"messaging\" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he had\\nno overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aide\\nabout this, he pointed to what had been billed as a \"major speech on the economy,\" at Georgetown University in April\\n2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both\\nObama and his top staff. An ally says, \"You can\\'t leave a message if you don\\'t have a strategy and you don\\'t know where\\nyou\\'re going.\" Another says, \"They had something that worked in the campaign but didn\\'t work in the White House.\"\\nThus, Obama didn\\'t see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all over\\nthe place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obama\\'s oft-used theme, that we\\nshouldn\\'t go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didn\\'t believe that the country was making\\neconomic, progress.\\nSo Obama\\'s biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded his\\nswearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who\\nwere not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation,\\nso smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain—and explain again—to the country what he was\\ndoing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010\\ncampaign....\\nMore than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to\\ndefend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:\\n\"Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn\\'t always think about making sure we got the\\nadvertising properly about what was going on.\" Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was\\ngenerally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, \"Bullocks! What policies?\")\\nThe risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care\\n(with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic\\npress conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn\\'t\\nreally understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, \"Their definition of\\ngoverning is passing bills.\" Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so\\ncriticized for being \"arrogant\" and \"aloof,\" he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (\"And I take responsibility for that,\"\\nObama said again and again.)McHale, Judith A <McHaleJA@state.gov>\\nThursday, December 9, 2010 8:11 PM\\nRE: LA Times/Laura King - Afghan TV police drama delivers message with zest\\nIn Singapore now heading back this afternoon.

Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in support of Senate\\nratification of the New START Treaty:\\n\"The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, was signed by the United States and Russia on April\\n8th and transmitted for the advice and consent of the Senate on May 13th of this year. Since then, the U.S. Senate has\\nheld 18 hearings and as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have worked with my colleagues to\\nscrutinize this agreement and ensure any classified matters are properly vetted. Much has changed since the original\\nSTART was first negotiated in 1991, and as a result I have supported efforts to make certain that questions regarding our\\nability to verify Russian compliance with the Treaty\\'s limits, to develop and deploy effective missile defenses, and to\\nmodernize our nuclear weapons complex, have been satisfactorily resolved.\\n\"I am confident that New START will provide predictability in our relationship with Russia and thus enhance global\\nstability, and most importantly, our national security. Therefore, if the Majority moves to consider New START under a\\nframework that allows for sufficient debate and amendments, I intend to support the Resolution of Advice and Consent.\"Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nSaturday, December 11,2010 12:08 PM\\nFw: LEAHY Calls For Freeze Of Funds To Haiti\\'s Central Government And Of Travel Visas\\nFor The Government\\'s Leaders\\nTraffic b/I explainsGovernment And Of Travel Visas For The Government\\'s Leaders\\nI am currently out of the office and unavailable before 6:00pm EST today, December 10.

We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the\\nCopenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at\\nmobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change.\\nToday I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions\\nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in\\nour global response to climate change.\\nThese agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord\\'s mitigation\\npledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and\\nAnalysis which will provide confidence that a country\\'s pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;\\ncreate a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a\\nframework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation.\\nThe Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United\\nStates will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue\\nbuilding on this progress.\\n###See NI\\nMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nSaturday, December 11,2010 1:36 PM\\nFw: S is calling Leahy today - thx for all the help; advise if a diff no for him todayFor The Government\\'s Leaders\\nInterestingOne START update: new START remains in the mix for next week, but when it will be fit into the schedule is not firmly\\ndecided. On Monday at 3.00 pm, the Senate will vote on cloture on the tax bill. They expect to obtain cloture. If the\\nopponents require the use of all 30 hours, post-cloture, they will finish the tax bill on Tuesday evening. It is possible\\nthat new START will then be the next order of business. But that hasn\\'t been decided yet. They could turn to the\\nomnibus or back to don\\'t ask don\\'t tell as a stand alone measure. but we are still in the mix, and will have to keep\\npushing with Reid, Durbin, Schumer etc.On the first, we have shared with them all of our intel on likely\\nRepublican votes. I think they know we are now well north of 67 votes. On the second, we have confirmed with the\\nparliamentarian that we can move from the treaty to the appropriations bill by consent or with a simple majority vote.\\nSo if we begin start on tuesday night there is a way to get both measures done by the weekend.

But apparently not for Michael R.\\nThe mayor\\'s company, 3loomber,\\n,3 L.P., said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media\\nenterprise in an effort to broaden the company\\'s influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has an\\nagreement with the city to have no involvement in the \"day-to-day operations\" of his company, the endeavor, called\\nBloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview.\\n\"I think it\\'s very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with the\\nvalues and beliefs of the founder — even if he happens to be mayor of New York City,\" said Matthew Winkler, the editor in\\nchief of Bloomberg News. \"I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people to\\ncome away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.\"\\nThe effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yet\\nanother potent communications apparatus — one that carries his name and imprimatur — to sound off on issues that\\ncollide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire.\\nBloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg has\\na direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would not\\navoid such issues but would disclose the mayor\\'s involvement when warranted.\\nThough Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from time\\nto time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said.\\n\"I think that there\\'s a very good chance that\\'s going to happen,\" he said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg\\'s occasional\\ninvolvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at\\narm\\'s length from the company.\\nA spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city.\\n\"Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded,\" he said.\\nAs someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorial\\npage is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg\\'s plans. (On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run for\\npresident.)\\nThe unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg\\'s online and print media properties — including Bloomberg\\nBusinessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and\\nbusinesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of\\nstate under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.\\nOpinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact,\\nthe mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in\\nthe blogosphere.\\nBut company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two\\nyears ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence.\\nFor a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting an\\neditorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service.\\nThe notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old\\none in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers.\\nMr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed\\neditorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him.\\n\"He\\'s accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul,\" said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City\\nUniversity of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of Hearst. \"This is what we all do. We try to persuade the\\nrest of the world we are right. Of course we don\\'t have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.\"\\nMr. Winkler said: \"There\\'s a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literally\\nseize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can\\'t always do that with the best result with\\nreporting.\"\\n\"That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, the\\ncompany, that it should take advantage of,\" Mr. Winkler added.\\nBloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy of\\naccomplishment.\\nBloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation that\\nwill eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about government\\nservices and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation\\'s capital.Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\\nThursday, December 16, 2010 9:28 AM\\nFW: From PakistanTHE NBC/YORKER\\nDecember 14, 2010\\nThe Envoy\\nPosted by Hendrik Hertzberg\\nLast night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend\\napproached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of\\na holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. \"Richard Holbrooke died,\" she said.\\nNotwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this\\nsudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about\\nhim was large: his physical size, including the ultimate \"in your face\" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw\\nvoice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)\\nand forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for\\ndanger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He\\nwas no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular\\nwars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.\\nUnlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him\\nin the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a \"source,\" a prolific and forceful writer whose\\nfavorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I\\'ve spent my working life. He was\\ngregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the\\nNew York Public Library\\'s \"Literary Lions\" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on\\nhis feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.\\nAt sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.\\nNot long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him\\nif he liked Warren Zevon\\'s wonderful song \"The Envoy.\" He said he\\'d never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After\\nthat, he mentioned it every single time I\\'ve seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he\\nneeds a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.\\nIf the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the\\nSecretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more\\npositive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken\\nheart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that\\nbrought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be\\nthe most important he ever spoke.\\nPhotograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images\\nRead more\\nhttp://www. newyo rker. corn/on line/b log s/hend ri khe rtzberq/20 10/1 2/ho lb rooke. htm 1?p ri ntab le=true#ixzz\\n1 8HjNL4knHi.
